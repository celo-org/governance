Overview
============================
- CGP-0195
 
## Status
- DRAFT
 
Proposal Description
============================
## Summary
This proposal seeks funding to sustain and expand the Celo Communities Guild program across Discord, Telegram, Reddit, and X (Twitter) from **July to December 2025**. 
Since August 2021, the initiative has safeguarded community spaces and encouraged engagement, activities now more important than ever as the Celo Foundation continues decentralizing operations. By keeping an experienced moderation team in place and enlarging incentive budgets, the Guild will strengthen collaboration, counter misinformation, and nurture the long-term growth of the ecosystem.

### Motivation
Vibrant online communities drive innovation on Celo. Discord, Telegram, and Reddit are public goods where users learn, contribute, and connect. Moderators uphold quality dialogue, assist newcomers, and block scams. They also act as the coordination layer between regional DAOs and the global network, especially on Discord, ensuring information flows smoothly and voices from every locale are heard. Continued support for the Guild is therefore essential to community trust and ecosystem momentum.

### Objectives
1. **Enhance Community Engagement** – Foster active, meaningful, and welcoming interactions across all platforms to strengthen community bonds.
2. **Maintain Platform Safety** – Enforce the Code of Conduct and enhance moderation to reduce spam, scams, and other harmful behaviors.
3. **Increase Ecosystem Awareness** – Amplify updates and initiatives from projects and regional DAOs to grow visibility across the Celo ecosystem.
4. **Reward Participation** – Support community quests, giveaways, and incentive programs like the Celo Community Steward initiative to encourage ongoing engagement.
5. **Facilitate Community Growth** – Onboard and support new members, builders, and contributors, ensuring a smooth path into the ecosystem.

### Specification
Building on a strong history of driving community engagement and ensuring a secure environment, this proposal lays out clear plans to strengthen moderation, reward active participation, and foster deeper collaboration across platforms such as Discord, Telegram (including main Celo Account and some other regional or language dedicated accounts), and Reddit.

1. **Active Moderation**
- Ensure 24/7 coverage on Discord, Telegram, and Reddit.
- Uphold the Code of Conduct and address incidents quickly.
2. **Community Hangouts**
- Host bi-weekly calls on Discord.
- Reward engagement and participation on the call in the form of NFTs and Celo token.
3. **Engagement Incentives**
- Expand the Discord + Guild.xyz point system.
- Organize contests, quests, and giveaways to promote participation.
4. **Ecosystem Collaboration**
- Deeper collaboration with the Celo Regional council to amplify their initiatives.
- Coordinate with the Celo Foundation and other ecosystem entities for cross-promotion.
5. **Transparency and Reporting**
- Publish monthly activity reports and key metrics.
6. **X Account**:
- Manage the @CeloCommunities account to amplify community news and updates and share contests and engage with Community.
7. **Google Services and Domains**:
- Cover monthly payments for Google Services and domain renewals to maintain operational efficiency
_(Operational costs for HashBot,, and premium Discord and Telegram subscriptions are already covered through 2025 H1 and thus excluded from this request.)_

### Metrics and KPIs
- Lower average response time to inquiries.
- Increase monthly active engagement across channels.
- Reduce Code of Conduct violations.
- Track FAQ themes and sentiment trends.
- Grow participation in Guild.xyz quests.

## Current Status
The Guild successfully met its H1 2025 targets by being a totally autonomous entity for the first time. Detailed spending records and monthly reports are available [\[here\]](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-communities-guild-reports/). Building on that foundation, this proposal requests renewed funding to maintain momentum and add capacity for H2 2025.
Over the past six months (January–June), we have diligently tracked our expenses, which are transparently documented [\[here\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SEOnmhHipJ2WUQiANgzHTSsQrgR7TsWRlHcB_xsa820/edit?usp=sharing). These records underscore our commitment to accountability and keep demonstrating the program’s value and impact.

## Timeline and Milestones (Monthly)
- Active moderation in Celo Guilds _(Discord, Telegram & Reddit),_ keeping those channels free of spam.
- Bi-weekly Community Hangout calls.
- Ongoing Guild.xyz quest campaigns.
- Regular amplification of ecosystem news.
- Active coordination with the Celo Foundation, cLabs, and other ecosystem entities to keep roles, access and information up to date. 
- Exercise and enforce the community’s [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).
- Monthly internal moderator meetings and reporting.

## Detailed Budget
We are requesting a total of **51,090 cUSD + 10,000 Celo** from the Community Fund to support **six months** of operations. The cUSD portion will be allocated primarily to cover the payments of three full-time moderators, 1 part-time moderator, and to fund the essential tools required for our work. The **10,000 Celo** will be exclusively dedicated to fostering community engagement through contests, quests, giveaways, and similar initiatives.

Payments will be distributed monthly, with performance-based reviews to ensure the program's objectives are met effectively.

Risks
============================
- This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.
- This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

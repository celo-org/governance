# Abstract
To spread awareness about the Celo protocol and increase its adoption, grow the Celo community with initiatives in the most used languages in LatAm (Portuguese and Spanish! 3), and help nurture the next cohort of great initiatives on Web3.
Celo has one of the most global communities in crypto. 
In order to further expand decentralization and the localization of the protocol in different regions and cultures, we would love to empower local communities to lead local growth.
We believe that folks on the ground are the most equipped to do this and that a grassroots approach will benefit the growth of Celo and its community.


# Proposal

## Goal
Bring to life next gen of dApps and partnerships to Celo by exploring #REFI use cases and opportunities, and contribute with the community in projects towards raising awareness about the Celo protocol and increase its adoption, grow the Celo community with initiatives in the most used languages in LatAm (Portuguese and Spanish!).

Celo has one of the most global communities in crypto. In order to further expand decentralization and the localization of the protocol in different regions and cultures, we must empower local communities to lead local growth. Decision power and initiatives must be shifted to folks on the ground who are the most equipped to collab and achieve a grassroots approach that will benefit the growth of Celo and its community.

## Amount Requested

## Areas of Focus

### Accelerating Growth: Web3 Venture Builder (Solution Design + Project Development and Shipping + Capital)**
Create a Web3 Venture Studio to launch the next gen of Web3 initiatives by: (i) helping expressive Web2 companies launch on Celo and (ii) nurturing native web3 initiatives.

Founders on Celo community may play a joint role in this initiative: either by providing services, collaborating and/or other formats that we feel may further advance the Celo mission.

Countries and initiatives that are more mature and show product market fit will be prioritized. LatinAmerica is a vast region and while we have representatives of different countries and aim to further increase reach, initial actions will focus on more mature markets and initiatives.

We may co-organize the initiatives together and report to the community.

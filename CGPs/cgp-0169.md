## Overview
 
This proposal aims to implement the changes of the The [Great Celo Halvening](https://forum.celo.org/t/the-great-celo-halvening-proposed-tokenomics-in-the-era-of-celo-l2/9701) by setting the right configuration parameters. These changes were already approved by a temperature check. 

This proposal is meant to be proposed before the network transitions to an L2 and timed so that it's ready to be executed shortly after the transition.
 
 
## Proposed Changes

 
1. Set the max voting yield
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setTargetVotingYieldParameters(
    uint256 max=250000000000000000000,
    uint256 adjustmentFactor=0
    )
  - Value: 0
2. Set the target voting yield
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setTargetVotingYield(uint256 targetVotingYield = 51500000000000000000)
  - Value: 0
3. Set RPC nodes rewards
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setTargetValidatorEpochPayment(uint256 value = 82191780820000000000 (82.19 cUSD per day))
  - Value: 0
4. Carbon offset epoch reward
  - Destination: FeeHandler
  - Data: setCarbonFraction(uint256 newFraction = 100000000000000000000000)
  - Value: 0
6. Set base fee distribution
  - Destination: FeeHandler
  - Data: addOtherBeneficiary(
    address beneficiary = TODO,
    uint256 _newFraction = TODO,
    string calldata name = cLabs
  )
  - Value: 0
7. Set carbon fund
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setCarbonOffsettingFund(address partner = 0xCe10d577295d34782815919843a3a4ef70Dc33ce (unchanged), uint256 value = ) 
  - Value: 0
8. Make the comission update five times longer as long (block time is 5 times faster)
  - Destination: Validators
  - Data: setCommissionUpdateDelay(uint256 delay = 259200)
  - Value: 0
9. Set RPC slasher
  - Destination: GovernanceSlasher
  - Data: setSlasherExecuter(address _slasherExecuter = TODO)
  - Value: 0
10. Set RPC score commitee

  - Data: setScoreManagerSetter(address _scoreManagerSetter = TODO)
  - Value: 0
11. Fund RPC manager comitee
  - Destination: StableToken
  - Data: approve(address spender = TODO, uint256 value = TODO)
  - Value: 0

 
## Verification

Current parameters can be checked with:

`$ celocli network:parameters -n https://forno.celo.org`

They should be consistent with the adjustment described in this proposal:

`$ celocli governance:show --proposalID $PROPOSAL_ID --jsonTransactions release-12-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org`

 
## Risks
 
Highlight any risks and concerns that may affect consensus, proof-of-stake, governance, protocol economics, the stability protocol, security, and privacy.

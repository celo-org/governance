## Overview

This proposal is a proxy governance proposal that mirrors Mento Governance Proposal 12 (MGP-12). As part of the ongoing coordination between the Celo community and the Mento community, Celo token holders have the opportunity to vote in Mento Governance with the Celo Community fund Mento Allocation.

### Summary

MGP-12 proposes rebranding all Mento stablecoins from the `cXXX` symbol convention to `XXXm`, aligning with Mento's multichain strategy and establishing a unified brand identity. For example, `cUSD` becomes `USDm`, `cEUR` becomes `EURm`, and so on. The token names are adjusted accordingly, i.e. `Celo Dollar` becomes `Mento Dollar` and so forth.

As Mento evolves into a global FX layer with multichain capabilities, a unified naming convention is essential. The "m" suffix stands for "Mento-native" and signals that these assets are designed for use across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

This rebranding:

- Prepares Mento for seamless multichain adoption
- Strengthens Mento's independent brand identity
- Maintains full backwards compatibility — all contract addresses remain unchanged

This is a **branding-only change** with no modifications to smart contract addresses, collateralization mechanisms, or fiat pegs.

The following tokens will be renamed:

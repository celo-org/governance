## Overview

Following the successful deployment on Celo Sepolia, which introduced Succinct's ZK Fault Proofs and EigenDA v2, the cLabs team seeks community feedback on activating the Jello Hardfork on Celo mainnet.

The Jello Hardfork represents a critical advancement in Celo's evolution as an Ethereum Layer 2, bringing OP Succinct Lite and zero-knowledge proofs to mainnet. This upgrade is entirely on the proposer side - full nodes do not need to take action.

A "Yes" vote indicates support for proceeding with the Jello Hardfork activation on Celo mainnet as described in this proposal. A "No" vote indicates opposition to the hardfork. An "Abstain" vote will help achieve the minimum quorum needed while neither supporting nor opposing the proposal.

### Proposal Description

#### OP Succinct Lite Integration

The Jello Hardfork introduces OP Succinct Lite fault proofs to Celo mainnet, following successful validation on Celo Sepolia. This upgrade brings:

**Enhanced Dispute Resolution**: Zero-knowledge based fault proofs provide faster, cheaper, and more reliable verification for Layer 2 activity. Proofs are only generated when needed, reducing operational costs while maintaining security guarantees.

**Non-Interactive Proofs**: Simplified and efficient dispute resolution with minimal overhead and shorter dispute duration compared to traditional interactive fraud proofs.

**L2Beat Compliance**: Fulfillment of L2Beat criteria for decentralized fault-proof operation, strengthening Celo's position in the Layer 2 ecosystem.

#### Technical Improvements

**EigenDA v2 Support**: Continued integration with EigenDA v2 as the data availability layer, now enhanced with ZK proofs that can cryptographically prove data has been posted to EigenDA.

**Performance Enhancements**: Stability improvements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations validated through extensive testing on Sepolia.

**Celo EVM Compatibility**: Maintained support for Celo's unique EVM extensions including token duality and fee abstraction (native support for paying gas with any token).

#### Architecture Benefits

The upgrade represents a major advancement in Celo's modular stack, combining:
- ZK-powered security through OP Succinct Lite
- Optimism's Kona execution engine for EVM compatibility  
- EigenDA's scalable data availability
- Celo's mobile-first payment optimizations

This architecture delivers faster, lower-cost infrastructure essential for stablecoin and payment applications requiring speed, cost efficiency, and reliability.

## Proposed Changes

No on-chain changes will be implemented with this temperature check proposal. This proposal gauges community sentiment before proceeding with the actual Jello Hardfork deployment.

The future Jello Hardfork activation would include:

1. **Proposer Update**: Deployment of updated proposer software supporting OP Succinct Lite fault proofs
2. **Smart Contract Activation**: Hardfork activation via on-chain governance mechanism
3. **Fault Proof System**: Integration of ZK-based dispute resolution replacing existing fraud proof system

## Verification

This command should show no transactions, as this is a temperature check proposal with no on-chain actions:

$ celocli governance:show --proposalID [PROPOSAL_ID] --node https://forno.celo.org

## Risks

As there are no on-chain actions performed with this temperature check proposal, no immediate risks arise from its execution.

Future risks related to the actual Jello Hardfork deployment would be minimal given:

**Extensive Testing**: The Jello Hardfork has been thoroughly validated on Celo Sepolia under production-like conditions

**Proposer-Only Changes**: The upgrade is limited to proposer infrastructure, minimizing impact on the broader network

**Backward Compatibility**: Full compatibility maintained for users and applications with no breaking changes

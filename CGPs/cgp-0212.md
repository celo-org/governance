## Overview

**TLDR:**

Announcing the Jello Hardfork, the Celo network upgrade that will bring OP Succinct Lite and ZK proofs to Celo mainnet. Following the successful deployment on Celo Sepolia, we propose activating the Jello hardfork on mainnet in November. The upgrade is entirely on the proposer side. Full nodes do not need to take action.

Dear Celo community,

Following the successful deployment on Celo Sepolia, which introduced Succinct's ZK Fault Proofs and EigenDA v2, the cLabs team is excited to propose the next major milestone in Celo's evolution as an Ethereum Layer 2 built for real-world payments.

**The Jello Hardfork is ready for mainnet.**

With OP Succinct Lite successfully validated on Celo Sepolia, we now propose deploying this critical upgrade to Celo mainnet in November.

This milestone marks a critical advancement in Celo's roadmap to become the most performant and secure Ethereum-aligned L2 optimized for stablecoin and mobile transactions worldwide.

## Introduction and Context

The Jello Hardfork has been successfully validated on Celo Sepolia. The Sepolia deployment validated integration between OP Succinct Lite and EigenDA v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of zero-knowledge (ZK) fault proofs in improving scalability, cost efficiency, and security.

Now, with successful testing complete, we propose extending Jello to Celo mainnet to bring these critical improvements to production.

## What's New in Jello

The Jello Hardfork will introduce to mainnet:

- Official integration of OP Succinct Lite fault proofs (successfully tested on Celo Sepolia)
- Enhanced dispute resolution powered by ZK-based fault proofs
- Continued support for EigenDA v2 as the data availability layer, with new ZK proofs that can prove that data has been posted to EigenDA
- Fulfillment of L2Beat criteria for decentralized fault-proof operation
- Stability improvements, bug fixes, and performance enhancements from extensive testing
- Continued support for Celo EVM extensions like token duality and fee abstraction (native support for paying for gas with tokens)

Together, these upgrades represent a major advancement in Celo's modular stack, combining ZK-powered security, Optimism's Kona execution engine, and EigenDA's scalable throughput into a cohesive architecture.

## Why It Matters

OP Succinct Lite brings faster, cheaper, and more reliable verification for Layer 2 activity:

- **Faster and low cost dispute resolution**: Proofs are only generated when needed, reducing cost
- **Non-interactive proofs**: Simplified and efficient dispute resolution with minimal overhead and shorter duration
- **ZK security guarantees**: Strengthening Celo's alignment with Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap

For stablecoin and payment applications, where speed, cost, and reliability are essential, this upgrade provides the foundation for seamless global value transfer on-chain.

## Timeline and Upgrade Process

### Sepolia Success
The Celo Sepolia deployment successfully demonstrated the integration of OP Succinct Lite and EigenDA v2 under production-like conditions, validating performance and stability goals.

### Proposed: The Jello Hardfork on Mainnet

- **Successfully deployed** on Celo Sepolia with full validation
- **Proposed mainnet activation**: November 2025, following community approval
- **Preparation**: No action is required from users or node operators. The Jello upgrade will be automatically activated via a smart contract switch and an updated proposer once the hardfork is approved and activated. Full nodes do not need to take action.

The transition is designed to be smooth and non-disruptive, with full backward compatibility for users and applications.

## How to Get Involved

For those interested in learning more, technical documentation and release details are available on docs.celo.org and the official GitHub repository. Community members are encouraged to share feedback and observations in this thread as the team monitors Sepolia performance and to participate in the governance process by reviewing and voting on this Jello Hardfork proposal for mainnet deployment. Your participation helps ensure transparency, accountability, and community consensus as Celo advances toward a modular, Ethereum-aligned future.

## Looking Ahead

The Jello Hardfork represents another step toward a fully modular, Ethereum-aligned rollup architecture for Celo, meeting L2Beat's decentralization standards while preserving Celo's focus on mobile-first payments.

With successful validation on Sepolia complete, the cLabs team, along with partners at Succinct, EigenLabs, and Optimism, is ready to bring these improvements to mainnet and continues to collaborate closely to push the boundaries of secure, scalable, and affordable Layer 2 infrastructure.

## Closing

The cLabs team thanks the Celo community and ecosystem partners for their continued collaboration, testing, and feedback throughout the Sepolia deployment and as we move toward mainnet activation.

This proposal for the Jello mainnet hardfork marks another key milestone toward a modular and Ethereum-aligned future for Celo, delivering faster, lower-cost infrastructure to power the next generation of global payments.

In line with standard practice for major network upgrades, the cLabs team has notified the Celo Security Council of the successful Jello Hardfork activation on Celo Sepolia and this proposed mainnet deployment.

## Risks

<ol>
  <li>There are couple of risks factors to take into account when launching new stablecoin like eXOF :</li>
  <ol>
      <li>Risks associated with underlying collateral backing eXOF (EUROC in our case).</li>
      <li>XOF deviates from official peg to EUR;</li>
      <li>Data providers report the price that is different from the actual XOF/EUR exchange rate.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>In conjunction with the Mento team the contract changes have been thoroughly tested, in addition to putting tight limits and circuit breakers during the initial launch phase to protect the Mento Reserve and eXOF holders.</li>
</ol>

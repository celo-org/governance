## Overview

In the recent Mento Community Calls, there was a consensus that, for maximum protection of cStable holders during these extreme market conditions, the reserve should not only aim for a 30\% allocation in stable value assets (as agreed upon in CGP 56) but rather target a lower floor for the stable asset basket at 100\% cStables value outstanding. Additionally, the Mento community spoke out for a 50/50 split of the stable asset basket in DAI and USDC instead of a DAI only allocation. This CGP aims to cement this mandate by putting both changes to a Celo community wide on-chain vote. The 100% collateralization of the Mento stables by the stable portfolio is the highest priority target of the reserve allocation.

With this floor, the reserve is instructed to sell stable reserve assets during reserve rebalancing sessions only if there is at least a 100% backing of all cStables in stable reserve assets.

As long as 100% of all Mento stable assets are backed by the stable asset portfolio, 50% of the overall reserve should be in CELO, since CELO is the asset traded for stables in the Mento stability mechanism.

The remainder of the reserve should be in other non-Celo assets previously approved by governance, namely BTC, ETH and natural capital assets (currently cMCO2). The target weights applied to the remainder of the reserve are 49% BTC, 49% ETH and 2% natural capital assets.


## Example

An example based on the the USD amounts of Mento stables outstanding on Jun 14:

cUSD in circulation: 59,638,627 USD

cEUR in circulation: 35,721,525 USD

cREAL in circulation: 1,757,026 USD

TOTAL: 97,117,178



Allocating 97,117,178 USD to the stable portfolio is a reserve weight of 41.82% on Jun 14.

CELO Weight: 50%

Remaining Reserve: 8.18%

-   Of the remainder 49% BTC: 4.01%
    
-   Of the remainder 49% ETH: 4.01%
    
-   Of the remainder 2% cMCO2: 0.16%
    

Formally, let C denote the USD value of all cStables outstanding and R denote the total reserve USD value. We can then distinguish between three different cases:

1. $\frac{R}{C} \geq  2$: All cStables are fully backed by stable assets, half of the reserve is in Celo and the rest is split across BTC, ETH and natural capital assets with $w_{Stable} = \frac{C}{R}$, $w_{CELO} = 0.5$, $w_{BTC} = (1-w_{Stable}-w_{CELO})\times0.49$, $w_{ETH} = (1-w_{Stable}-w_{CELO}) \times0.49$ and $w_{cMCO2}=(1-w_{Stable}-w_{CELO})\times 0.02$

2. $1  \leq  \frac{R}{C} < 2$: All cStables are fully backed by stable assets and in addition CELO with $w_{Stable} = \frac{C}{R}$, $w_{CELO} = 1 - w_{Stable}$

3. $\frac{R}{C} < 1$: the Reserve is undercollateralized and only holds DAI and USDC ($w_{Stable} = 1.0$)
    
## Proposed Changes

No on-chain changes. This proposal is simply aiming to add precision to the reserve mandate.

  
## Verification

No on-chain changes.


## Risks

- DAI and USDC contain regulatory, custodial and counterparty risk. Introducing a mix of USDC and DAI diversifies those risks compared to a pure DAI holding.

- The reserve could miss market price upside compared due to increased stable asset basket allocation.

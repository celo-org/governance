## Overview

This proposal covers the fourth phase of the Mento Protocol Upgrade (MU04) which deprecates Mento V1 and completes the transition to Mento V2. Additionally it updates the StableToken implementation to a more modern ERC20 implementation with reduced gas costs.

A more detailed description of the changes to the protocol can be found in the v2.2.1 [release notes](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-core/releases/tag/v2.2.1), and in the [docs](https://docs.mento.org).
An in-depth description of the governance proposal aimed at approves and developers can be found in the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mento-upgrade-mu04-phase-out-v1-fully-transition-to-v2-and-update-stabletoken/7034).

## Proposed Changes

## Verification

## Risks

While the contract changes have been thoroughly tested by the Mento team, and [audited](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/mento-1) by Macro, we’ve taken additional steps to ensure the protocol's safety. However, there is always the risk of smart contract exploits which could affect the stability of the protocol.

Since multi-collateral Mento requires reserve assets like USDC and EUROC to be bridged to Celo, the upgrade exposes the Mento reserve to bridge risk. In the case of an exploit of the bridges in use (Axelar and Wormhole at this point), the respective bridged assets could become worthless.

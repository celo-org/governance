## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 13. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v13).

It is currently undergoing audit.

Now that CELO has successfully migrated from being an L1 to an L2, L1 related code can now be safely removed. It doing so, the size of the relevant contracts is decreased and contract execution and gas cost is improved.

## Proposed Changes

Updated contracts:

1. `Validators.sol`: `1.2.0.5` => `1.3.0.0`
2. `Accounts.sol`: `(1.1.4.2` => `1, 2, 0, 0`
3. `GoldToken.sol`: `1.1.3.0` => `1, 2, 0, 0`
4. `Election.sol`: `1.1.4.0` => `1, 2, 0, 0`
5. `EpochRewards.sol`: `1.1.2.0` => `1.2.0.0`
6. `Governance.sol`: `1.4.2.0` => `1.5.0.0`
7. `GovernanceSlasher.sol`: `1.1.1.0` => `1.2.0.0`
8. `EpochManager.sol`: `1.1.0.0` => `1.1.0.1`

## Verification

First, make sure to download latest [celo-monorepo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/) with

`$ git clone git@github.com:celo-org/celo-monorepo.git --branch release/core-contracts/13`

And a version of the cli compatible with this contract release, you can install it with:

`$ npm install -g @celo/celocli@6.2.5`

Then build the project it with:

`$ yarn && yarn build`

Once built, `cd` to the protocol folder with:

`$ cd packages/protocol`

From there, you can download the current proposal:

``` bash
celocli governance:show --proposalID TBD --jsonTransactions release-13-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

And then verify that the proposal deployment matches the audited release:

``` bash
yarn verify-release -p release-13-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v13 -n mainnet -f -i "releaseData/initializationData/release13.json"
```

The output should verify that the bytecodes and storages match what is expected, it should look something like this:

``` bash
Success, no bytecode mismatches found!
Writing linked library addresses to libraries.json
âœ¨  Done in 30.86s.
```

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

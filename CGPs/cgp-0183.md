# Budget Request: Celo Kreiva DAO Grant: Season 0-1 2025

* Receiver Entity: Celo Governance
* Status: [DRAFT]
* Title: Celo Kreiva DAO Season 0-1 2025
* Author(s): @hawwal @COT @iamoracle @emiridbest
* Type of Request: Funding
* Funding Request: $177,000 cUSD

# Introduction

Celo kreiva is a “Purpose Driven Creative DAO” aimed at building a vibrant community of artists, digital creators, and collectors within the Celo ecosystem. This proposal seeks to establish a creative cosmos powered by creatives. You can check out the discussion article written some months back [here](https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-creators-ecosystem-in-celo-l2/9504).

This proposal aims to establish a creative DAO through which grassroots grants are accessible to artists, gamers, digital creators, creator lab teams, and creative projects for the sole purpose of building a creator economy within Celo.

**What are we are trying to achieve:**

* Drive a dynamic influx of creative projects and individuals into the ecosystem by inspiring the birth of creative projects, attracting skilled individuals or groups to contribute their expertise and energy to the ecosystem.
* Contribute more liquidity into the network through creativity.
* Promote native Celo token vesting and lockups in Celo Kreiva DAO utilizing Aave protocol to encourage investor confidence in the DAO.

Celo Kreiva DAO is moving towards investing community funds in great creatives that will draw more liquidity into the network. This initiative will undoubtedly amplify Celo’s reputation in the Ethereum creator economy.

**Key objectives include:**
Grassroots grants to support creatives provided:

* Creative projects are connected to the Celo ecosystem.
* Creative initiatives that encourage the adoption of Celo.
* Creative projects with Tangible ROIs
* Drive the adoption of ecosystem products.
* A thriving creative community is created.
* Impactful creative projects with real-world use cases.

# Motivation

The creator economy was expected to grow from over $250 billion in 2024 to more than $480 billion in 2027. Web3 enables creators to cut out intermediaries and monetize their work directly.

However, Celo has no established community for creatives. Thus, investing in a creator ecosystem will allow Celo to:

* Increase adoption through digital creators and NFT communities;
* Become a major stakeholder in the Eth creator economy;
* Enable real marketing and community engagement.
* Offer small grants to help close the funding gap for emerging artists.

The absence of a clear grant program for creatives only makes this initiative more pressing. Our purpose is to enable creative projects and communities to create a cosmos of creativity, where artists and creators can thrive creating prosperity conditions for creativity within the Celo ecosystem.

### Why apply for Celo Kreiva

**Why would creators apply for this grant?**
Successful applicants will be Immediately adopted into the DAO which will expose them to Celo ecosystem stakeholders and industry players. Frequent workshops as well will be organized to empower these creatives.

### 3. Value Proposition:

**How it will benefit the Celo blockchain:**
**Creators:**
As a creative DAO, we are passionate about originality and have decided to be thorough about the art pieces displayed in our collection. In partnership with [Rarible X](https://x.rarible.com), we’ll be launching an NFT marketplace where only genuine art will be minted.

**How do we go about this:**
Creators will be able to submit their NFT project proposals to snapshot on a monthly basis where the DAO through governance can decide on NFT projects to support by adding to the Celo Kreiva’s collection. From these, collectors can purchase to gain access to governance privileges within the DAO.
Check out “how to propose Testnet” repo [here](https://github.com/Celo-Kreiva-DAO/How-to-Propose)

**Collectors:**
Collectors holding Celo Kreiva NFT’s will have access to our governance and have the ability to make proposals that contribute to the overall wellbeing of the DAO.

We will facilitate the launch of these NFT projects as long as they meet our requirements.

### 4. Strategy:

In line with Celo Governance Season 0, we will establish a Grants Council consisting of four moderators responsible for reviewing applications during each grants season alongside a (Guardian or Steward) - Advisory role to actively oversee and support the DAO’s activities to ensure inclusivity and decentralization. The council will rotate biennially, allowing more passionate community members the opportunity to participate in critical decision-making within the DAO governance model. This structure reinforces transparency and contributes to a more decentralized ecosystem.

### 5. Voting:

Snapshot, Charmsverse.

### 6. Celo Kreiva DAO Governance:

**Please Note:** “The concept shared below in this category is actively under development and is now available on testnet, you can check out our [Github](https://github.com/orgs/Celo-Kreiva-DAO/repositories) for more information. Our team will deploy on mainnet pending Celo’s stakeholders decision outcome of the proposal.”

**Token-Based Governance:** Inspired by Nouns’ approach to bootstrapping identity and collective decision-making, Celo Kreiva DAO will adopt an NFT CELO ERC721 token-based governance model, where holders of our NFT will have the power to make proposals and vote on projects using snapshot, Community members will have a chance to shape the future of Celo Kreiva through NFTs with governance advantages.

**Council Oversight:** council members or moderators will oversee the administrative aspects of the DAO, ensuring the smooth operation of our community and initiatives

**Funding Sources:** Our funding will come from grants, NFT sales and Loans.

#### Governance Details:

**1. NFT Voting:**

* One vote per NFT, capped at 10 votes per holder to prevent whale dominance.

**2. Council Selection:**

* Open call via forum, community vote on Snapshot.
* Biennial rotation, 4 members max.

**3. Transparency:**

* All votes recorded on Snapshot.
* Council meeting minutes shared on Telegram.

**4. Dispute Resolution:**

* Community veto via 60% NFT holder vote on snapshot.

# Metrics and KPIs:

* **Quarterly Reports:**
Every three months, we will have reports highlighting our progress so far, and completed milestones.
* **Percentage on completed/pending projects:**
These are projects that have received funding or yet to receive, also projects that have been completed or yet to be completed.
* **Community growth numbers:**

## Risks

The following risks and concerns may affect the Celo Kreiva DAO proposal, along with mitigation strategies:

- **Governance Centralization**: The 2/4 multisig wallet (controlled by four team members) could raise concerns about centralized control. **Mitigation**: All transactions require approval from at least two signers, and council meeting minutes will be shared on Telegram for transparency. The biennial rotation of the Grants Council ensures broader community participation.
- **Fund Mismanagement**: Improper allocation of the $177,000 cUSD budget could undermine grant distribution. **Mitigation**: Monthly treasury reports via Remox and quarterly progress reports on the Celo Forum will detail fund usage.
- **Low Grant Applicant Quality**: Insufficient high-quality creative projects could limit impact. **Mitigation**: A rigorous scoring rubric (Celo adoption 30%, ROI 40%, team expertise 20%, on-chain validation 10%) and partnerships with Regional Hubs and Celo Camp will attract diverse, qualified applicants.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: The NFT-based governance model and multisig wallet could be targets for attacks. **Mitigation**: The governance model is being tested on testnet ([GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Celo-Kreiva-DAO/repositories)), and mainnet deployment will follow security audits. The multisig wallet uses established Celo protocols for secure fund management.

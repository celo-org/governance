## Overview

CGP 89 - G\$ oracle whitelisting

This proposal is the second and final governance proposal needed launch G\$ as gas token. It was preceeded by [CGP-85](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0085.md)

* G\$ is a token distributed as UBI, making it a gas token can help further easily onboard users to web3 without the need to hold "Celo" or other "Stables" that the user would otherwise need to purchase.
* G\$ is "stable enough", see dashboard in links for its price history.

### Status

This proposal should not be executed until at least one oracle report for G\$ has been submitted on-chain, and G\$ token was upgraded to support gas token functionality.

## Proposed Changes

This proposals adds whitelisting G\$ as gas currency.

1. Enables G\$ as a gas currency
  - Destination: FeeCurrencyWhitelist.addToken
  - Data: StableToken(`0xe8537a3d056DA446677B9E9d6c5dB704EaAb4787`)
  - Value: 0

## Verification

Can be verified with the cli by running: `celocli governance:view --proposalID 84`

## Risks

* G\$ price risk: G\$ is not a stable asset
* There's only one oracle running on openzeppelin defender, in case of an issue it can cause degraded performance for users trying to pay gas fees with G\$

## Overview *(please provide an overview of your proposal)*
 
This proposal aims to implement the changes of the The Great Celo Halvening by setting the right configuration parameters. These changes were already approved by a temperature check. 

This proposal is meant to be proposed before the network transitions to an L2 and timed so that it's ready to be executed shortly after the transition.
 
 
## Proposed Changes

 
1. Set the max voting yield
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setTargetVotingYieldParameters(
    uint256 max=250000000000000000000,
    uint256 adjustmentFactor=0
    )
  - Value: 0
2. Set the target voting yield
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setTargetVotingYield(uint256 targetVotingYield = 51500000000000000000)
  - Value: 0
3. Set RPC nodes rewards
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setTargetValidatorEpochPayment(uint256 value = 82191780820000000000 (82.19 cUSD per day))
  - Value: 0
4. Carbon offset epoch reward
  - Destination: FeeHandler
  - Data: setCarbonFraction(uint256 newFraction = 200000000000000000000000)
  - Value: 0
6. Set base fee distribution
  - Destination: FeeHandler
  - Data: addOtherBeneficiary(
    address beneficiary = TODO,
    uint256 _newFraction = TODO,
    string calldata name = cLabs
  )
  - Value: 0
7. Set carbon fund
  - Destination: EpochRewards
  - Data: setCarbonOffsettingFund(address partner = 0xCe10d577295d34782815919843a3a4ef70Dc33ce (unchanged), uint256 value = ) 
  - Value: 0
8. Make the comission update five times longer as long (block time is 5 times faster)
  - Destination: Validators
  - Data: setCommissionUpdateDelay(uint256 delay = 259200)
  - Value: 0
9. Set RPC slasher
  - Destination: GovernanceSlasher
  - Data: setSlasherExecuter(address _slasherExecuter = TODO)
  - Value: 0
10. Set RPC score commitee
  - Destination: ScoreManager
  - Data: setScoreManagerSetter(address _scoreManagerSetter = TODO)
  - Value: 0
10. Fund RPC manager comitee
  - Destination: StableToken
  - Data: approve
  - Value: 0

 
## Verification
 
An explanation of how voters can verify that this CGP does what it intends to do. Can be left as “TODO” until the proposal is made. Include things like CLI commands to run and pointers to code.

Current parameters can be checked with:

`$ celocli network:parameters -n https://forno.celo.org`

 
## Risks
 
Highlight any risks and concerns that may affect consensus, proof-of-stake, governance, protocol economics, the stability protocol, security, and privacy.
 
## Useful Links
 
* Optional section
* Links to related CIPs or other documents (eg. if this is a proposal to point to a new instance of a smart contract that was updated)

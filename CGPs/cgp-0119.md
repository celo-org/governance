Relative share of PG Bucket: 100%

Summary
-------

[Celo Camp 3](https://www.celocamp.com/) has been an accelerator for founders building in our ecosystem since 2019. As we direct the focus of Celo's flagship accelerator towards MiniPay, Upright asks the Celo Community to support our work by allocating $325,000 cUSD and 100,000 CELO to enable Cohort 9 (Q1 2024). This proposal will cover the next batch of Celo Camp (6 month) along with continued development and operation of our self-guided program, [Startup Pathway 2](https://www.startup-pathway.com/).

Over the last 4 years, [Upright](https://www.upright.gg/) has shipped 8 cohorts, serving memorable teams such as [impactMarket](https://www.impactmarket.com/), [Moola Market](https://moola.market/), [Halofi](https://halofi.me/), [Talent Protocol](https://www.talentprotocol.com/), [Kotanipay](https://kotanipay.com/), [Flow Carbon](https://www.flowcarbon.com/), [Fonbnk](https://fonbnk.com/), [Figment](https://figment.io/), [Paychant](https://paychant.com/), [Umoja 1](https://umoja.money/), [Masa Finance](https://masa.finance/), [Symmetric](https://symmetric.finance/), [Plastiks](https://plastiks.io/), [Resource Network](https://resource.finance/), [Eldorado 2](https://eldorado.io/en/) and [CarbonPath](https://www.carbonpath.io/). Our alumni have collectively raised more than $200 million dollars and have processed more than $1.5bn in on-chain transactions. We would like to support founders for years to come: welcoming them, serving them, and wiring them into the very heart of Celo.

On November 15th, 2023 Upright and the Celo Foundation launched the inaugural [MiniPay Launchpad 1](https://blog.celo.org/build-for-minipay-applications-for-celo-camp-batch-8-are-now-open-97fafd7d90cc) (batch 8) in which the program's curriculum and go-to-market were adapted to focus on Africa and MiniPay, while leveraging our existing alumni network and partners in the region. We have onboarded 17 teams from Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and 20 mentors from notable VCs and companies (some of whom are proudly Celo Camp alumni themselves). In addition, we created a dedicated [virtual space](https://www.minipaylaunchpad.com/) where mentors, VCs and MiniPay founders can connect and grow together. On December 19th, 2023 we concluded the cohort with the program's [Demo Day](https://twitter.com/celo_camp/status/1737165431029244255) in which some of our top graduates showcased their projects. The winners of the MiniPay Launchpad were announced [here](https://blog.celo.org/introducing-celo-camp-batch-8-winners-866337024ec4).

With the launch of [MiniPay 1](https://blog.celo.org/opera-launches-minipay-the-worlds-lightest-payments-wallet-to-onboard-its-millions-of-mobile-df80469ab2b9) and its exposure to Opera's +100M users, Celo builders gain exclusive access to users across Africa through the Discover page (an "appstore"-like experience). We see the launch of Opera MiniPay as a pivotal moment where users in Africa can experience a truly seamless onboarding experience into Web3.

Given these exciting developments, and as evident from our latest batch we believe 2024 will see an unprecedented influx of founders from the region. The goal of this proposal is to ensure Celo Camp is ready to support these builders.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KPIs we will measure and report to the community at the end of each batch (twice a year):

-   Total # applicants per batch.

-   Total # graduates who have successfully integrated with MiniPay/Celo including project pitch and live demo.

-   Net promoter score (NPS) greater than 60 - we want to ensure our MiniPay builders have a great experience and turn into leaders in the Celo ecosystem and promoters of the program.

KPIs collected and reported to the community within 6 month following each batch:

-   Total funds raised by alumni.
-   Total Celo on-chain transactions by alumni.
-   Total on-chain active addresses by alumni.
-   Total active alumni open source repos.

*As some of this information is not publicly available the measurement of these KPIs is based on a bi-yearly alumni survey.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A [self-guided educational program 2](https://www.startup-pathway.com/) for founders and builders in the Celo ecosystem. Through our newly designed 6-week program, founders get access to learning resources, structured curriculum and accountability through our dedicated LMS (learning management system), which features fully audible content, networking opportunities, Celo rewards, and community support.

The Upright team have developed two tracks for the program:

The Entrepreneurial Track\
Designed for entrepreneurs entering the Celo ecosystem. The program covers all the major entrepreneurial milestones and includes topics such as User Research, UX, Building and Integrating to Celo and The Art of the Pitch.

The Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Track\
An A to Z class on this remarkable technology. ZKPs have immense potential to revolutionize the web3 space by addressing the critical need for privacy, security and scale. As research and development in this field continues, ZKPs are likely to find even more groundbreaking applications in the future.

This, one of its kind course, is tailored for the Celo ecosystem. It covers:

-   Introduction to ZKPs.
-   ZKPs for product managers: How to incorporate ZKPs into your own project, including the study of example use cases. The goal of this module is to give the learner an "intuition" for where ZKPs might be applicable.
-   Introduction to Plumo.
-   Walkthrough of developing an open the treasure chest game which demonstrates using Plumo to verify NFT ownership.
-   Walkthrough of developing a simple ZKP Sudoku game and deploying a circuit to the Celo network.

The ZKP track will be published on Feb 01, 2023, [stay tuned 2](https://www.startup-pathway.com/).

The Startup Pathway program has become an integral part of the Celo Camp journey and a way for us to make the content we create available to anyone who wishes to build on Celo. The program also allows us to develop new resources for Celo Camp's curriculum with the feedback of the border Celo community.

SP Notable alumni:\
[RedStone](https://redstone.finance/), [Clixpesa 2](https://clixpesa.com/), [Flywallet 1](https://www.flywallet.io/), [Vault3 1](https://www.vault3.net/), [Bingtellar 1](https://bingtellar.com/), [Bulla.network](https://bulla.network/).

*Flywallet, Vault3, Bingtellar and Clixpesa graduated from both SP and Celo Camp.

The Upright team will operate, refine the existing tracks based on the feedback we get from learners and create a new dedicated track for MiniPay.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The success metrics we believe to be appropriate for the upcoming cohort are:

Celo Camp batch 9

-   At least 150 applicants.
-   Between 15-30 teams will be selected for camp.
-   80% of Celo Camp graduates will demonstrate their integration with MiniPay and/or Celo.
-   Net promoter score (NPS) greater than 60.

Startup Pathway

-   100 signups.
-   15-30 participants.
-   Releasing a new MiniPay track.

10-20 open source Git repo submissions from Celo Camp and Startup Pathway.

The success metrics will be collected and made public at the end of the cohort.

*These success metrics are how we envision a successful batch and what we believe to be achievable based on our past results. Having said that this specific program is fairly new and achieving these KPIs is not fully under our control and may vary based on market conditions, go-to market and the actual start date of the event among other factors. Our team as always will do its best to maximize these KPIs.

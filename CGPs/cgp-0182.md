## Overview

Following the successful launch of cGBP, cAUD, cZAR, and cCAD stablecoins, this proposal completes the stablecoin expansion initiative with the launch of cCHF, cNGN, and cJPY. This final phase fulfills the vision of introducing seven new local currency stablecoins for G7 and key African markets, as outlined in the [original forum discussion](https://forum.celo.org/t/launch-new-mento-stablecoins-jpy-gbp-aud-cad-chf-ngn-zar/10603). This proposal builds on the previous work:

- [CGP 177 (Adding oracles to support GBP, AUD, CAD, CHF, ZAR stablecoins)](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-177)
- [CGP 178 (Launch of the cGBP, cAUD, cZAR & cCAD Stablecoins)](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-178)
- [CGP 180 (Adding oracles to support JPY and NGN stablecoins)](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-180)

The proposal includes transactions that when executed will do the following:

- Launch and initialize each stablecoin.
- Create and configure the following pools:
  - cUSD/cCHF
  - cUSD/cNGN
  - cUSD/cJPY
- Configure trading limits and circuit breakers

## Risks

There are some risk factors to take into account when launching new stablecoin:

- Data providers report the price that is different from the actual exchange rate.

In conjunction with the Mento team the contract changes have been thoroughly tested, in addition to putting tight limits and circuit breakers during the initial launch phase to protect the Mento Reserve and holders of the new stable coins.

Proposal Description
============================

This proposal is a proxy governance proposal that mirrors Mento Governance Proposal 10 (MGP-10). As part of the ongoing coordination between the Celo community and the Mento community, certain governance decisions initiated in the Mento forum require formal ratification through the Celo Governance process.

The original MGP-10 can be found here: [MGP-10: Restructuring the Mento Reserve Yield on Mento Reserve & Mento Funding](https://forum.mento.org/t/mgp-10-restructuring-the-mento-reserve-yield-on-mento-reserve-mento-funding/93)

This CGP does not introduce new changes beyond those specified in MGP-10. Instead, it acts as the execution layer within the Celo governance system, ensuring proper alignment between the two governance processes.

Abstract
============================
This proxy CGP proposes restructuring the way the Mento Reserve yield is allocated between the Mento Reserve itself and Mento Funding, following the specifications defined in MGP-10. The intent is to improve the sustainability and transparency of Mento protocol funding while ensuring alignment with Celo governance.
Fill out the following template for each transaction in the proposal

Motivation
============================
The Mento community has deliberated and reached consensus on MGP-10, which restructures how reserve yield is distributed. For the decision to take effect, execution through Celo’s on-chain governance is required.

This proxy CGP ensures:

Alignment of Celo and Mento governance outcomes.

Execution of the Mento community’s decision within the Celo protocol.

Continued decentralization and clarity in protocol funding mechanisms.


Specification
============================
The full specification, including parameters, rationale, and implementation details, is defined in MGP-10: [MGP-10: Restructuring the Mento Reserve Yield on Mento Reserve & Mento Funding](https://forum.mento.org/t/mgp-10-restructuring-the-mento-reserve-yield-on-mento-reserve-mento-funding/93)

This CGP acts as a binding proxy and does not alter or reinterpret the contents of MGP-10. The on-chain governance vote on this CGP will execute the decisions described in MGP-10.

## Transaction Descriptions

No transactions, a yes/no vote will be carried out by the approvers depending on the outcome of the CGP.

## Json Script
N/A

 
Risks
============================
- Misalignment between Celo governance and Mento governance processes could create ambiguity.
- Execution risk if implementation details are not faithfully mirrored from MGP-10.

These risks are mitigated by the proxy nature of this CGP: it strictly reflects MGP-10 without modification.

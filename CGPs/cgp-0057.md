## Overview

The proposal is to allow Di Wu as an oracle runner for [Mento](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/stability/doto#what-is-mento), the stability mechanism behind the Celo Stables. Di Wu has previously shown interest in running the oracles in a [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/decentralized-oracles/3610/2) calling the community to run oracles.

Di Wu has offered to provide this service ad honorem.

## Security

Attached is a security assetment of Di Wu's infrastructure from cLabs team, by Benjamin Speckien, Head of Security.

## Proposed Changes

1. Remove cLabs as CELO/USD oracle
  - Destination: Disable one address to report to CELO/USD
  - Data: `SortedOracles.removeOracle(cUSD address = 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a, cLabs oracle = 0xca9ae47493f763a7166ab8310686b197984964b4, oracle index = 9)`
  - Value: 0
2. Enable Di Wu as CELO/USD oracle
  - Destination: Enabling one address to report to CELO/USD
  - Data: `SortedOracles.addOracle(cUSD address = 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a, Di Wu CELO/USD oracle = 0xF8ffaB8cCB81BcD0DF7f9dF97Ccf8bEF782ebEeB)`
  - Value: 0
3. Remove cLabs as CELO/EUR oracle
  - Destination: Disable one address to report to CELO/EUR
  - Data: `SortedOracles.removeOracle(cEUR address = 0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73, cLabs oracle = 0xBD955F84e11EE53095F9068b88C9d2Ffd3Def707, oracle index = 9)`
  - Value: 0
4. Enable Di Wu as CELO/EUR oracle
  - Destination: Enabling one address to report to CELO/EUR
  - Data: `SortedOracles.addOracle(cEUR address = 0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73, Di Wu CELO/EUR oracle = 0x3F2691d5B4839c226f4Bd096DC744914cAD5737e)`
  - Value: 0
5. Remove cLabs as CELO/BRL oracle
  - Destination: Disable one address to report to CELO/BRL
  - Data: `SortedOracles.removeOracle(cREAL address = 0xe8537a3d056DA446677B9E9d6c5dB704EaAb4787, ADDRESS3-CLABS = 0x7F045f538c3837D9096205e740A0173eA860c400, oracle index = 9)`
  - Value: 0
6. Enable Di Wu as CELO/BRL oracle
  - Destination: Enabling one address to report to CELO/BRL
  - Data: `SortedOracles.addOracle(cREAL address = 0xe8537a3d056DA446677B9E9d6c5dB704EaAb4787, Di Wu CELO/BRL oracle = 0x4eb4571a475Bea99b6A735B89aae664b82c964a3)`
  - Value: 0

Note: Removal of oracles are batched at the begining so index don't change after adding the oracles, and make it simpler to verify.
## Verification

The content of the proposal can be fetched using the cli:

`$ celocli governance:view --proposalID TODO --node https://forno.celo.org`

Addresses of the stables can be verified with

`$ celocli network:contracts --node https://forno.celo.org`

where `StableToken` is `cUSD`, `StableTokenEUR` is `cEUR` and `StableTokenBRL` is `cREAL`.

And addresses for the oracles to be removed can be verifies with:

`$ celocli oracle:list <stable address> --node https://forno.celo.org`

Index in the proposals should match the zero-based-index in the output from the cli.

## Risks

Celo oracles work by enabling a list of oracles to report and calculating a median of the report. One individual provider can not influence the median on their own, the only way to affect it would be to control half the oracles plus one.
There's still a risk of hack of their infrastructure plus the incentives changing for Di Wu to turn malicious. The community will have to be vigilant that community-run oracles are behaving properly.

## Overview

This proposal will whitelist the Chainlink relayer contract required to support ETH as a gas currency after Celo's transition to an Ethereum L2 on March 26, 2025 [(official announcement)](https://forum.celo.org/t/returning-home-to-ethereum-the-launch-of-celo-l2-mainnet/10466). The ChainlinkRelayer will transmit price data from an aggregation of multiple Chainlink price feeds (CELO/USD and ETH/USD) to the SortedOracles contract.

The rate feed involved is CELO/ETH, which has a relayer contract already deployed. Details of the rate feed and corresponding relayer contract are provided in the table below:

| RateFeed        | RateFeedId                                   | Relayer Contract                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| relayed:CELOETH | `0xF3CAaE71EAc2DA8D78372A62DDb3acdDaf3Df416` | [0xd5bAF8D2072B2dB54Bed9c4763D591a44C408A98](https://celoscan.io/address/0xd5bAF8D2072B2dB54Bed9c4763D591a44C408A98) |

## Proposed Changes

1. **Add CELO/ETH relayer as oracle**

   - Destination: SortedOracles.addOracle
   - Data: `0xF3CAaE71EAc2DA8D78372A62DDb3acdDaf3Df416`, `0xd5bAF8D2072B2dB54Bed9c4763D591a44C408A98`
   - Value: 0

2. **Set token report expiry for CELO/ETH**

   - Destination: SortedOracles.tokenReportExpirySeconds
   - Data: `0xF3CAaE71EAc2DA8D78372A62DDb3acdDaf3Df416`, 360
   - Value: 0

## Risks

The data relayed by the ChainlinkRelayer contract is only as secure as the Chainlink price feeds it relies on. If the Chainlink price feeds are compromised, the data relayed by the ChainlinkRelayer contract could be manipulated. This could lead to the SortedOracles contract reporting incorrect rate feeds to the rest of the protocol.

This risk is present with all Oracle solution and is not specific to the Chainlink price feeds. With that said, this particular feed is considered low risk as it's data will only be used as a reference price for gas price calculations.

## Overview

This proposal covers the third phase of the Mento Protocol Upgrade (MU03) which introduces three new exchanges namely cEUR/axlUSDC, cBRL/axlUSDC and cEUR/axlEUROC to the protocol. It allows us to further extend the trading pairs with non-CELO collateral. Together with the new exchanges we also made some changes to the on-chain Circuit Breaker logic to add additional safety measures.

A more detailed description of the changes to the protocol can be found in the v2.2.0 [release notes](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-core/releases/tag/v2.2.0), and in the [docs](https://docs.mento.org). An in-depth description of the governance proposal aimed at approves and developers can be found in the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mento-upgrade-mu03-enable-more-trading-pairs-and-continue-phasing-out-v1/6462).

## Risks

While the contract changes have been thoroughly tested by the Mento team, and [audited](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/mento-1) by Macro, we’ve taken additional steps to ensure the protocol's safety. Specifically, we’re still using the temporary PartialReserve which holds limited collateral. However, there is always the risk of smart contract exploits which could affect the stability of the protocol.

Since multi-collateral Mento requires reserve assets like USDC, EUROC, ETH and BTC to be bridged to Celo, the upgrade exposes the Mento reserve to bridge risk. In the case of an exploit of the bridges in use (Axelar and Wormhole at this point), the respective bridged assets could become worthless.

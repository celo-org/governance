## Risks

There are some risk factors to take into account when launching new stablecoin:

In conjunction with the Mento team the contract changes have been thoroughly tested, in addition to putting tight limits and circuit breakers during the initial launch phase to protect the Mento Reserve and holders of the new stable coins.

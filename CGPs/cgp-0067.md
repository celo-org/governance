## Overview

This proposal enables T-systems as an oracle provider for CELO/USD, CELO/EUR and CELO/BRL, building up on the effort started in (CGP 57)[https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0057.md]. This proposal also funds with the Community Fund (ReleaseGold contracts)[https://docs.celo.org/holder/manage/release-gold] (RGC), in order to reward the oracle providers for their service. Two RGC for T-system and one for Di Wu, already running an oracle. One contract is the month-to-month payment for one year of service, and the other one to cover for startup cost, with a three-month cliff. The price of Celo was set at the time of deployment, aprox at $0.62. It may vary slightly from my contract to the other due to volatility.

The terms of service for the oracles operations, as well as the payments, are defined in (this document)[https://forum.celo.org/t/decentralized-oracles/3610/18?u=max_dt]. The Celo Comunnity would be agreeging to this terms by passing this proposal.

## Proposed Changes

Value for every transaction is `0`.

1. Remove cLabs as CELO/USD oracle
  - Destination: `SortedOracles`
  - Data: `removeOracle(cUSD address = 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a, cLabs oracle = 0x223ab67272891Dd352194bE61597042eCf9C272a, oracle index = 8)`
2. Enable T-Systems as CELO/USD oracle
  - Destination: `SortedOracles`
  - Data: `addOracle(cUSD address = 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a, T-Systems oracle = 0xD0d94f4b02e3Ec4734f36ecfEc155547bF8cE87A)`
3. Remove cLabs as CELO/EUR oracle
  - Destination: `SortedOracles`
  - Data: `removeOracle(cEUR address = 0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73, cLabs oracle = 0xC5280DDbDEC37540436935C01C912869B2d5Ae1c, oracle index = 8)`
4. Enable T-Systems as CELO/EUR oracle
  - Destination: `SortedOracles`
  - Data: `addOracle(cEUR address = 0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73, T-Systems oracle = 0x2C7769d3241b08251b3d46662c59f1C4E9D6bb1a)`
5. Remove cLabs as CELO/BRL oracle
  - Destination: `SortedOracles`
  - Data: `removeOracle(cREAL address = 0xe8537a3d056DA446677B9E9d6c5dB704EaAb4787, ADDRESS3-CLABS = 0xd1f3D8Fc2446D2Ff0E2408ae33A0097A4c94E381, oracle index = 8)`
6. Enable T-Systems as CELO/BRL oracle

8. Funding T-Systems monthly payment contract
  - Destination: `GoldToken`

9. Funding DiWu one-time payment contract
  - Destination: `GoldToken`

10. Funding DiWu monthly payment contract
  - Destination: `GoldToken`

## Verification

### Confirm proposal steps

Run `celocli governance:view --proposalID X` // TODO add proposal ID once submitted proposal

### Confirm the address of the oracles that are removed with

Addresses for the oracles to be removed can be verifies with:

`$ celocli oracle:list StableTokenX --node https://forno.celo.org` with X being `USD`, `EUR` or `BRL`.

Index in the proposals should match the zero-based-index in the output from the cli.

###  Confirm Release Gold Parameters:
`celocli releasegold:show --contract RG_ADDRESS`


## Risks

Celo oracles work by enabling a list of oracles to report and calculating a median of the report. One individual provider can not influence the median on their own, the only way to affect it would be to control half the oracles plus one.
There's still a risk of hack of their infrastructure plus the incentives changing for Di Wu to turn malicious. The community will have to be vigilant that community-run oracles are behaving properly.

Proposal Description
============================
This proposal requests funding to continue and scale the Celo Communities Guild throughout the period from January to June 2026, supporting its presence across [Discord](http://chat.celo.org/), [Telegram](http://t.me/celoplatform), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/celo/), and [X](https://x.com/Celo).

Active since August 2021, the program has played a key role in protecting community channels and fostering meaningful participation. This role has become increasingly critical as the Celo Foundation advances its decentralization efforts. Maintaining a seasoned moderation team while expanding incentive allocations will allow the Guild to improve coordination, reduce the spread of inaccurate information, and support the ecosystem’s long-term development.

During Season 1, we also showed that a program of this nature can operate effectively in an autonomous and self-managed way, validating the sustainability of the model going forward.

## Motivation
Strong and active online communities are a key driver of innovation within the Celo ecosystem. Platforms such as [Discord](http://chat.celo.org/) and [Telegram](http://t.me/celoplatform) function as shared public spaces where users exchange knowledge, collaborate, and build relationships. Moderators play a crucial role in maintaining constructive conversations, supporting new members, and preventing fraudulent activity. In addition, they serve as an important coordination bridge between regional HUBs and the broader global community. This is particularly true on [Discord](http://chat.celo.org/), where moderators help ensure that information circulates clearly and that perspectives from all regions are represented. For these reasons, ongoing support for the Guild is fundamental to preserving community trust and sustaining ecosystem growth.

---
## Objectives
1. Strengthen Community Engagement: Encourage consistent, high-quality, and inclusive interactions across all channels to deepen relationships within the community.
2. Preserve Platform Safety: Uphold the Code of Conduct and reinforce moderation efforts to limit spam, scams, and disruptive behavior.
3. Expand Ecosystem Visibility: Promote updates, initiatives, and contributions from projects and regional HUBs to improve awareness across the Celo ecosystem.
4. Incentivize Participation: Enable community quests, giveaways, and reward programs, including initiatives such as the Celo Community Steward program, to motivate sustained involvement.
5. Support Community Expansion: Welcome and guide new members, builders, and contributors, providing a clear and accessible entry point into the ecosystem.

## Specification
Building on a proven track record of strengthening engagement and maintaining safe community spaces, this proposal outlines concrete actions to further enhance moderation, incentivize participation, and deepen coordination across key platforms including [Discord](http://chat.celo.org/), [Telegram](http://t.me/celoplatform), covering the main Celo account as well as selected regional and language-specific channels, and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/celo/).

* Uphold the Code of Conduct and address incidents quickly.

2. Community Hangouts

3. Engagement Incentives

## Current Status
The Guild successfully met its H1 & H2 2025 targets by being a totally autonomous entity for the first time. Detailed spending records and monthly reports are available [[here](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-communities-guild-reports/)]. Building on that foundation, this proposal requests renewed funding to maintain momentum and add capacity for H1 2026.

Over the past six months (June–December), we have diligently tracked our expenses, which are transparently documented [[here]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SEOnmhHipJ2WUQiANgzHTSsQrgR7TsWRlHcB_xsa820/edit?usp=sharing). These records underscore our commitment to accountability and keep demonstrating the program’s value and impact.

---
## Timeline and Milestones (Monthly)
* Active moderation in Celo Guilds *([Discord](http://chat.celo.org/), [Telegram](http://t.me/celoplatform) & [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/celo/))*, keeping those channels free of spam.
* Bi-weekly Community Hangout calls.
* Ongoing [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/celo) quest campaigns.
* Regular amplification of ecosystem news.
* Active coordination with the Celo Foundation, [cLabs](https://x.com/cLabs), and other ecosystem entities to keep roles, access and information up to date.
* Exercise and enforce the community’s [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).
* Monthly internal moderator meetings and reporting.

Risks
============================

This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

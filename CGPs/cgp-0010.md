## Overview

1.0.1 release fix a critical security vulnerability on the celo-blockchain node, thus it is important to upgrade the minimunClientVersion so that every participant upgrades their nodes.


Parameter Details:

minimumClientVersion.major: 1 → 1 (unchanged)
minimumClientVersion.minor: 0 → 0 (unchanged)
minimumClientVersion.patch: 0 → 1

## Proposed Changes

1. Increase MinimumClientVersion in BlockchainParameters contract to 1.0.1
  - Destination: BlockchainParameters, [setMinimumClientVersion](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/BlockchainParameters.sol#L53)
  - Data: major = 1, minor = 0, patch = 1
  - Value: 0 (NA)


## Verification

1. Confirm proposal steps: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID X` // TODO add proposal ID once submitted proposal

### Post-Execution Verification

* Check that the `minimumClientVersion` parameters have been updated through [getMinimumClientVersion](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/BlockchainParameters.sol#L82)
* Check that an geth client with a version lower than 1.0.1 returns an error

## Risks

Before this proposal is executed at least ⅔ of the validators **must be** running 1.0.1 already. If not, the network would stall. At present time, this condition is already met.

## Overview

When CeLatam was created, a venture studio was outlined as one of the initiatives it wanted to pursue. The approved budget in [CGP 76](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-76) for this specific initiative was $280K, equivalent to 424K CELO at the time (the Celo price used for reference at the time was approximately $0.67).

Since then, the price of Celo has dropped to $0.3246 (moving average of the last 25 days). The DAO currency holds 347,676.89 Celo staked and 65K Celo deposited into Aave, that adds up to a total of 412,676.89 Celo, equivalent to $133,954 at the time of writing.

In order to pursue the venture studio, without being at the same time exposed to Celo price fluctuations and dumping Celo to fund this initiative, we propose to return 347K Celo to the community fund and request $220K to guarantee the funding of the venture studio.

The budget is reduced from the original number ($280K) to be mindful of current market conditions, with the philosophy of doing more with less. This is more than a 20% budget reduction, without counting for inflation, while keeping the same objectives.

Direct investment and/or no-strings-attached advisory will be given to startups focusing on LATAM that are already building on Celo or intend to build on it.

65K Celo will be kept by the DAO for long-term incentive alignment with the Celo Community, to be deployed only after the budget in stablescoins has run out. It will be used to vote on governance, stake for validators and provide liquidity on Celo, particularly on projects focusing on Latam.


## Proposal Description

### About this proposal

Currently, CeLatam needs to sell CELO to fund its operations, and as it moves towards its original goals, it's exposed to market fluctuations, which is not the ideal scenario. To pursue sustainable growth, the organization's treasury needs to be composed of stablecoins, but swapping the current amount of CELO we hold in our treasury would not be good for CeLatam or the CELO token. 

Instead, it makes more sense to use the >2 million cUSD currently available in the [Community Fund](https://celoscan.io/address/0xD533Ca259b330c7A88f74E000a3FaEa2d63B7972) (at the time of writing) to move our CELO tokens back to the Community Fund, and get cUSD so we can continue to fund our operations without selling CELO.

This proposal does not seek to create a for-profit structure. Instead, the vision is to create a foundation, NGO, or other non-profit entity that can advise and support LATAM startups building on Celo. The final legal structure will be defined once the funding is approved, ensuring compliance and alignment with the program's mission. This entity will be governed by a board composed of the current CeLatam multisig signers, which may be rotated at the request of Celo Governance or CeLatam. The board will not hold equity directly in startups, but operational teams may earn advisory fees or carry when appropriate. Any remaining capital after startup exits (net of fees and carry) will be reinvested into new projects, creating an evergreen and self-sustaining ecosystem support vehicle. The goal is to make as close to an evergreen fund as possible.

12.32. Where we are coming from

It's important to highlight that the development of this Venture Studio is not a pivot but rather the culmination of CeLatam's long-term strategy since its creation in 2023. Everything we have done to date has been carefully aligned with our [Theory of Change](https://forum.celo.org/t/celatam-theory-of-change/8117), which outlined our vision to empower Latin America through Web3 by building a community of purpose-driven founders and developers solving real problems.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf2a60Wrx2WXOYB0lgUZRa9B40R4GaXnAqgaG3bcRCDA4yqk05xVz0Gc3RFnZxZ7bGUB5EjOHmq75g3VDLPjWzcSFSMBPfVrVQeCwhRf04VhJedWPq9NwusDddZrIQiRC7PvSWT?key=aX2ZFQC-2l_QuS_0j0xIAw)

Over the past years, CeLatam has:

-   Generated ecosystem intelligence through research (e.g., LATAM Ecosystem Reports, key aspects web3 in LatAm such as RWA, ReFi, and Stablecoins, of research focused on builders & founders, etc).

-   Build Awareness about Celo in LatAm, through co-hosting events, publishing reports on Celo presence and impact in LatAm, and how to get support to build on Celo.

-   Built a community foundation through local meetups and strategic events across Latin America.

-   Educated hundreds of builders and founders via content, webinars, hackathons, and our university bootcamps.

-   Supported early-stage teams with direct mentorship, funding, and exposure through initiatives like [Celo Incuba](https://forum.celo.org/t/dive-into-the-celo-incuba-report-by-celatam/8618), our tailored accelerator for impact-driven projects.

-   Laid the groundwork for the Venture Studio by forming a skilled and committed core team, mapping initiatives and topics with potential for scale, refining processes, and building partnerships across the region.

We have consistently prioritized long-term ecosystem growth over short-term metrics; the result is that even after two years of accomplishments, we still have a treasury that can keep us for a couple of months. Until now, our work has created the critical infrastructure, relationships, and insights necessary to now scale our impact by launching the CeLatam Venture Studio.

Below is a summary of our main achievements from these reports:

Lastly, the DAO has been using the CELO it holds responsibly---staking to elect validators in LATAM and earning rewards, as well as depositing tokens into Aave for additional yield. Our proposed token swap is in alignment with this prudent approach: protecting the DAO's assets while maximizing their impact on Celo holders.

### VerificationMetrics and KPIs

As part of our OKR framework, in our published [  CeLatam 2025 Strategy](https://forum.celo.org/t/celatams-strategy-for-2025-scaling-impact-and-innovation-in-latin-america/10859) we outlined our North Star (Empowering builders and scaling Web3 impact-driven initiatives in Latin America) and OKRs for this year. Between the OKRs, the following Key Results will guide our execution and help track impact:

-   KR1: Incubate and/or accelerate 5 high-potential projects throughout the year.

-   KR2: Enable 3 projects to secure funding or strategic partnerships by Q4 2025.

-   KR3: Build a network of 5 active venture capital funds supporting ecosystem projects.

Our process will include scouting, advisory, matchmaking, and in some cases, direct investment or resource allocation to selected teams.

Metrics will continue to be publicly reported and shared on the [Celo Forum](https://forum.celo.org/u/celatam/summary) and on the different [CeLatam's channels](https://linktr.ee/celatam), enabling the community to track progress and hold us accountable.

In terms of focus, Latin America is a diverse region, and the Venture Studio will prioritize:

-   Founders and teams with strong product-market fit or potential to reach it with support.

-   Initiatives in more mature Web3 ecosystems where infrastructure, community, and deal flow are already taking shape (e.g., Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico).

-   Collaboration opportunities with active Celo contributors and mission-aligned Web2/Web3 operators.

With this framework, we aim to not only build a pipeline of successful projects on Celo, but to do so in a way that is deliberate, measurable, and mission-driven.

### Current Status

CeLatam has been active since 2023. It currently counts on a committed team of six contributors, three of whom have been part of the journey since the very beginning.

In 2025, our team has remained focused on executing key initiatives aligned with our[  CeLatam Strategy](https://forum.celo.org/t/celatams-strategy-for-2025-scaling-impact-and-innovation-in-latin-america/10859). These include:

-   The launch of our university Bootcamps in Brazil and Colombia (with Mexico and Argentina coming next), designed to onboard and empower the next generation of Web3 builders.

Our regional collaboration is stronger than ever. As an active member of the Regional Hubs Council, CeLatam is coordinating closely with our fellow hubs in Latam Celo Colombia and Celo MÃ©xico on joint activations---starting with our current Bootcamps program. We are also proud to have [MiniPay as a sponsor of our Colombia Bootcamp](https://x.com/CeLatamOrg/status/1922400582188306706) and look forward to expanding this collaboration to drive real-world adoption of MiniPay and the Celo ecosystem in the region.

From an operational perspective, the Venture Studio budget is ready to be executed upon governance approval. We have already received legal counsel regarding optimal non-profit structures and jurisdictions for incorporating the Studio in Latin America.


### Timeline, Milestones & Detailed Budget

The CeLatam team is ready to begin executing this budget immediately upon approval. We are committed to a lean, milestone-driven approach to maximize the impact of every dollar, in line with our 2025 OKRs---especially Objective 4: Supporting the Development of High-Potential Projects.

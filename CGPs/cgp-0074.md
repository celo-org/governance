## Overview

This proposal contains the first major Mento Protocol Upgrade (MU01) which upgrades the protocol from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0. This upgrade rearchitects the protocol into a modular set of components. In the short term, it allows us to extend the trading pairs with non-CELO collateral starting with **USDC** bridged via [Axelar](https://axelar.network/), which will be followed by ETH and BTC. In the long term, it allows us to extend the protocol further with different pricing logic altogether. Alongside the new features, we’ve implemented new safeguards, such as the on-chain circuit breaker and trading limits. A more detailed description of the changes to the protocol can be found in the v2.0.0 [release notes](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-core/releases/tag/v2.0.0), and in the [docs](https://docs.mento.org).

The whole MU01 upgrade will be conducted in 3 phases, this proposal covers the first phase. Specifically, it covers upgrading existing proxies and configuring new proxies and non-upgradable contracts. An in-depth description of the governance proposal aimed at approves and developers can be found in the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mu01-phase1-multicollateral-mento/5245).

### Reserve funding

As part of the v2.0.0 release, we need to fund the new reserves with bridged USDC in order to offer a cUSD/USDC pool in Mento. Therefore we propose funding the PartialReserve contract initially:

- 100k axlUSDC - bridged from custodians on Ethereum
- 100k CELO - transferred from custodians on CELO

We will top-up progressively if needed until moving to Phase 2 in these increments.

Additionally, in preparation for future pools against other collateral assets in the reserve, we want to bridge additional assets to Celo and use them to improve DEX liquidity:

- $5m worth of ETH split between Axelar and Wormhole in a concentrated UniswapV3 pool
- $5m worth of BTC split between Axelar and Wormhole in a concentrated UniswapV3 pool
- $5m worth of Celo in a Celo/stCelo concentrated UniswapV3 pool.

## Proposed Changes

Check the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mu01-phase1-multicollateral-mento/5245) for a detailed description of the proposed changes.

## Verification

Check the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mu01-phase1-multicollateral-mento/5245) for a detailed description of verification steps.

## Risks

While the contract changes have been thoroughly tested by the Mento team, and [audited](https://www.verilog.solutions/audits/mento/) by Verilog, we’ve taken additional steps to ensure the protocol's safety. Specifically, we’re deploying a temporary PartialReserve which will hold limited collateral during the first phases of the upgrade while both v1 and v2 will be live in parallel. As the stages progress we will increase the collateral exposure and the throughput of v2 and reduce v1. However, there is always the risk of smart contract exploits which could affect the stability of the protocol.

Since multi-collateral Mento requires reserve assets like USDC, ETH and BTC to be bridged to Celo, the upgrade exposes the Mento reserve to bridge risk. In the case of an exploit of the bridges in use (Axelar and Wormhole at this point), the respective bridged assets could become worthless.

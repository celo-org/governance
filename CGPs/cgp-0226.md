## Overview
 
In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Release 15. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v15). Hexen has completed a code audit of this release, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal content.
 
## Proposed Changes

Updated contract(s):
1. Governance : `1.5.0.0` ⇒ `1.5.1.0`

New contracts:

N/A

Deprecated contracts:

N/A
 
## Verification
 
First, make sure to download latest [celo-monorepo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/) with

`$ git clone git@github.com:celo-org/celo-monorepo.git --branch release/core-contracts/15`

And a version of the cli compatible with this contract release, you can install it with:

`$ npm install -g @celo/celocli@latest`

Install Foundry, following their [docs](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry):

`$ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`

Then build the project with:

`$ yarn && yarn build`

Once built, `cd` to the protocol folder with:

`$ cd packages/protocol`

From there, you can download the current proposal:

```bash
$ celocli governance:show --proposalID [PROPOSAL_ID] --jsonTransactions release-15-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

And then verify that the proposal deployment matches the audited release:

```
yarn release:verify-release -p release-15-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v15 -n mainnet -f -i "releaseData/initializationData/release15.json"
```

The output should verify that the bytecodes and storages match what is expected, it should look something like this:

```
Success, no bytecode mismatches found!
Writing linked library addresses to libraries.json
✨  Done in 30.86s.
```
 
## Risks
 
Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

However, this release specifically addresses a critical bug that was causing incorrect fund distributions, so the risk of not implementing this fix outweighs the deployment risks.

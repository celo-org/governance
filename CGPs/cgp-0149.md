## Overview
 
Following a recent Forum post from cLabs, the community is requested to weigh in and vote on Celo's L2 off-chain data availability layer, powered by EigenLayer and EigenDA

A "Yes" vote will denote agreeing to use "EigenDA". A "No" vote will denote not using "EigenDA". An "Abstain" vote will denote neither agreeing to nor disagreeing with either option, but instead will help to achieve the minimum needed level of quorum needed to pass a resolution.

### Why should an off-chain data availability layer, powered by EigenLayer and EigenDA be chosen?

The Celo Foundation and EigenLayer teams have solidified a partnership to support the long-term growth of Celo’s Layer-2 ecosystem. This agreement includes Eigen Foundation’s first strategic grant, allocated to the Celo Foundation. The grant will fund cLabs’ ongoing development of the Celo Layer-2 and to support ecosystem projects that leverage the DA solution.

By utilizing Ethereum validators’ re-staked ETH, EigenDA provides a secure, decentralized, and cost-effective data availability layer.

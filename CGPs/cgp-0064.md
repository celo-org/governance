## Overview

<h1>CGP - 0064</h1>
<h3>Celo India DAO (Regional DAO)</h3>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43913734/201913719-37f9b7c8-95e5-4cba-be9d-657715789ec9.png)

- The complexity of India - 6th largest economy, 2nd largest population in the world. 
- If you're form India, you can definitely feel the enthusiasm and interest to be tech driven.
- It's been estimated that there are 120 million crypto users from India

<p>The size of India's market alone would be enough to attract our community and celo's innovations. We are almost too aware of the regulatory restrictions among others. But what's more important are the gaps in India that urgently NEED solutions that Celo's projects have built. We want to bridge this gap by establishing a strong presence of CELO in India and offering our communities a multitude of our innovations. </p>


:smiley: I am putting forward our updated proposal, based on the feedback and suggestions from the Celo community. As a team, who have been active part of the Celo founders, developers and community ecosystem, we aim to strategise through a 3 month pilot program. We believe that through small initiatives at the community grassroots levels, we will significantly create a big difference and help us to achieve our long-term vision in the country. 

<h1>CELO INDIA DAO Proposal</h1>
<hr>
A group of us that currently work as a part of Celo‚Äôs ecosystem and believe in its huge potential, have joined forces to **snowball Celo‚Äôs adoption in India**. With extensive experience of both Celo and India, our team is designing a framework to discuss with the Celo community our strategies to establish Celo in the 6th largest economy in the world. It is estimated that there are *115 million crypto-users in India*, alone.


<h4>This regional DAO will aim to achieve these goals:</h4>

1. Rapidly establish a presence for Celo‚Äôs ecosystem in India through local builders, crypto-user networks, financial institutes, tech companies, academic institutes and social impact interventions. 
2. Onboard and inform Indian builders, funders and crypto-enthusiasts, at large, to Celo blockchain. 
3. To expand and grow the Celo community in India using educational tools about Blockchain technology, Celo‚Äôs ecosystem and projects, and support the innovation of new projects that are in line with Celo‚Äôs mission.

> CELO‚Äôs vision of *‚ÄòProsperity for all‚Äô* and its position as a ‚Äòmobile first‚Äô blockchain makes it a perfect fit for India: an emerging market where nearly everyone has a mobile phone but does not have access to financial aid and inclusivity.

- Students in India often lack blockchain knowledge and skills despite the presence of over 50,000 higher education colleges across the country. 
- Celo India DAO aims to bridge this gap with a data-centric and community-participation model. 
- The DAO will engage youth communities directly and inspire them to innovate in the CELO ecosystem, as well as, support them in their innovations by mediating with relevant Celo community members. 


A DAO in India is best positioned to equip the talented and tech-immersed Indian community with blockchain skills and inspire them to create web3 applications employing the use of Celo blockchain, CELO, cUSD and interact with our blockchain.

`B) Community Meetups ü§ù Celo India Advocates Program`

The objective is to help increase the Adoption of Celo among crypto enthusiasts through organizing regular meetups & events in collaboration with other local event organizers if needed. 
- This would involve hosting meetups, airdrops, workshops, etc., on a regular basis. 
- The meetups would be a great platform to network & collaborate with other crypto enthusiasts. 
- The regional advocates appointed would be responsible and accountable for execution and recording results.

<h3>Celo India Advocates Program</h3>

The Celo India Advocates program will establish the foundations for meetups across major cities through a dedicated student network. 

Currently, we are proposing holding meetups & growing communities for *10 major regions in India*. 

We envision the program to go hand in hand with the Celo University Guild Program, initiative in India, previously introduced by the Celo Foundation earlier, in the year, where advocates belonging to the earmarked regions are also able to participate in college events, meetups, and roadshows that take place across campuses in the region, and help with logistics.

*To start with*, we will try to set up a network of student advocates from these regions, so that they can lead initiatives for these local meetups. 

- Kochi (Kerala)
- Chennai (Tamil Nadu) 
- Bangalore (Karnataka) 
- Panjim (Goa)  
- Mumbai (Maharashtra)
- Hyderabad (Telangana/Andhra Pradesh) 
- Ahmedabad (Gujarat)
- Delhi (Delhi) 
- Jaipur (Rajasthan)
- Kolkata (Bengal) 

*The process:*

1. The advocates network will be set up by the stewards of the DAO, through a process of online interviews, after shortlisting a list of candidates selected earlier using typeforms. 
2. The advocates will majorly be college youth community members from these local communities, with previous experiences in managing student communities in colleges on campus (Google Developer Groups, Facebook Developer Circles, ACM, IEEE), previously volunteered to conduct community/NGO/meetups initiatives. 
3. These advocates will be responsible for local event management, and requesting the necessary logistics, & invoicing which will be presented to the stewards for every meetup. 
4. India has a vibrant student community actively doing state wise meetups, for major tech groups. We seek strategic partnerships with these communities so that we can reach out to a wider audience and make impact at the grassroots level.

*Local regional meetups groups, will include the following activities:*


1. Presentations of most happenings in the Celo ecosystem.
2. Onboarding participants to Valora and other projects in the ecosystem through a referral program.
Inviting local founders in the ecosystem to discuss what they are building and why they are building on Celo. (ImpactMarket, Swap Bitssa, IntoTheVerse, DappLooker)
3. Mentorships for student communities (local workshops, roadshows ‚Äì where the advocates take on a small stack - like React Celo, or Celo Composer, Contract-Kit and teach budding developers in these communities to build dApps, and projects. 
4. Developing Web2xWeb3 synergies - communities exchange ideas on how web3 stack can aid problems faced in web2 stack
5. Local Developer Communities do a demo of their projects and explain the working of Celo and all information related to Celo Devrel. Also discuss ideas and problem statements provided in regional and international Celo hackathons.
6. Networking and seeking opportunities in the ecosystem
7. Watch Parties for major Celo Conferences like Celo Connect
8. Collaborations sought with other web3 communities active in various parts of India, like Polygon Advocates, PuneDAO, Solana India, Buildspace India, and LearnWeb3DAO India.
9. Periodic Newsletters related to major events, and news in the Celo ecosystem translated to local languages.

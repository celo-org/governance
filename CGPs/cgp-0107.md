## Overview

Celo Dapps over Apps is a community that aims to onboard and educate traditional developers, tech enthusiasts and creative builders about web3 and the potentials of building with Celo’s blockchain infrastructure.

We are solving the problem of lack of visibility. 9 of 10 developers in Africa are unaware of Celo’s developer’s friendly infrastructure and toolkits.

**Our Mission:** Bridging the gap between traditional developers, tech enthusiasts, creative builders and Celo’s blockchain technology.

We will kickstart this program by:

1. Establishing sub-communities in various institutions and regions in Nigeria and across Africa so as to expand our reach and onboard developers & creative builders in grass roots.
2. Workshop & training on the usage and implementation of Celo’s established solutions, developers toolkits, its mobile first wallet and decentralized apps.
3. Educate project founders, traditional developers and creative builders in Africa about the basics and in depth of Celo products, tools and how to join its mission.
4. Reaching out to established businesses in Africa guiding them through the process of integrating Celo mobile first wallet to their businesses as a payment method.
5. Build market awareness around Celo’s product through content creation and distribution.
6. Work with greener planet activists, onboard them to utilize Celo blockchain in creating solutions for climate change.

**Our Achivements:**

* We introduced Celo to over 400+ attendees in our just concluded web 3 art & cultural events.

**How do you know that people need your services?**

* Visibility: < 1% of 85,000 developers in Nigeria are aware of Celo’s developer friendly infrastructure and its crypto mobile wallet solutions.
* Branding Celo as the messiah of the good user experience that other web 3 applications lack for mass onboarding.
* 9 out of 10 gen z’s in Africa are web 3 enthusiasts but lack the knowledge needed to kickstart their web 3 journey.
* Traditional developers are looking for ways to transition into web3. Our hackathon and incubation program will be a turning point for developers in Africa.
* Businesses across Africa need reliable payment solutions. Celo’s Valora wallet will be integrated into businesses in Africa.
* Potential unicorn start-ups in Africa fail most of the time because of lack of support. We are dedicated to providing support to brilliant minds building amazing projects utilizing Celo’s blockchain.
* Greener planet activists need solutions in addressing Climate change problem.

**Grant received will be channeled into:**

* Conferences and events: We will organize global conferences and monthly seminars in various cities and institutions in Africa. Kindly check out some of the videos and picture of some of the conferences we have hosted:
* Workshop & Training for developers & non- developers on how to build with Celo. Kindly check out some of our technical workshops videos:

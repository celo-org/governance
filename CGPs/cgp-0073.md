## Overview

### Objective

The objective of this proposal is to establish a bug-bounty program on Immunefi and allocate 2,000,000 CELO from community governance funds.

### Immunefi

ImmuneFi is a security platform that provides decentralized bug bounty programs and security assessments for DeFi (decentralized finance) projects and blockchains.

The platform allows DeFi projects to create their own bug bounty programs with customized rules and rewards, and incentivizes security researchers to find and report security vulnerabilities in exchange for rewards in cryptocurrency.

In addition to bug bounty programs, ImmuneFi also offers security assessments and code reviews to help DeFi projects identify and fix vulnerabilities before they become critical security issues. This can help DeFi projects build more secure and trustworthy platforms for users.

For comparison, here is a list of other major blockchains and web3 services currently using Immunefi:

* Wormhole ($10,000,000* US in rewards)
* MakerDAO ($10,000,000* US in rewards)
* Polygon ($2,100,000* US in rewards)
* Optimism ($2,000,000* US in rewards)
* Algorand ($2,000,000* US in rewards)
* Gnosis ($2,000,000* US in rewards)
* Arbitrum ($2,000,000* US in rewards)

Any transaction requires the confirmation of 5 out of 7 signatories.

Multi-signatories agree to reveal their identity and will be compensated at a rate of 100 Celo per hour for their work on the project.

#### Budget

The CGP is requesting a total 2,000,000 CELO from the on-chain governance Community Fund.

1,950,000 Celo will be allocated to the Immunefi bounty fund.

To support the administration of the fund, a total of 50,000 Celo will be designated to admin compensation. The administrative work expected will include but is not limited to triaging, validating, verifying and relaying submissions, following up with submitters for additional information, status updates and general communication. Members shall receive 100 Celo for hours they work. A reasonable effort will go towards adjusting this amount as needed. All payments made will require 5/7 members to approve and pay to the aforementioned public addresses. A list of all administrative payments shall be available publicly by viewing the multi-sig wallet history.

## Verification

```json
[
  {
    "contract": "GoldToken",
    "function": "approve",
    "args": [
      "0x8AE64ABEDDEbEFE087Bd33876c7c26ddF6B9cD6B",
      "2000000000000000000000000"
    ],
    "value": "0"
  }
]
```

## Risks

There is a potential that the allocated funds could be used slowly in the event that there is not a large initial response to the program. To alleviate this potential risk, the necessity of the currently allocated funds will be re-evaluated at the end of a 12 month period beginning with the execution of this proposal. If the members of the multi-sig account believe that some funds should be returned, then a proposal will be submitted to return the funds in question to the community governance fund.

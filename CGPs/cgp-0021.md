## Overview

This proposal will effectively extend the expiration of a requested attestation from 1 HOUR -> 1 DAY, improving upon [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0015.md) which previously attempted to do so.

The initial [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0015.md) attempted to extend the expiration time of attestations from 1 hour to 24 hours by changing `attestationExpiryBlocks` in the Attestation contract. However, the `Random.sol` contract only retains randomness for a period of blocks specified by `randomnessBlockRetentionWindow`. Though the `Attestation.sol` contract was updated to be able to query randomness between 1 and 24 hours, the `Random.sol` contract remains unable to serve those requests. Therefore, the expiration time for attestations remains functionally 1 hour.

Extending the expiration period for attestations will help users complete the phone number verification process in the case when they do not select issuers within 1 hour of requesting attestations. See [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0015.md) for further context on the motivation for extending the expiration of requested attestations. 

## Proposed Changes

1. Set `Random.sol` `randomnessBlockRetentionWindow` to 60 * 60 * 24 / 5 (24 hours with 5 seconds per block). This will expand the state of the randomness contract from 720 to 17280 32-byte values.
  - Destination: `randomnessBlockRetentionWindow` - set via[`setRandomnessBlockRetentionWindow`](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/fb4f828a4e001b73a8c39aa34e3395f4015aaabc/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Random.sol#L59)
  - Data: 17280
  - Value: 0

## Verification

- Call `Random.sol` `randomnessBlockRetentionWindow()` to see that the current parameter value is 720. After execution of this proposal, that value will be 24 times greater, 17280.

## Risks

This does not introduce any incremental risk over the changes already implemented by passing [CGP 0015](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0015.md). There is no attack vector in which selecting issuers more than an hour after requesting attestation is advantageous.

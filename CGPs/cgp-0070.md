# Overview
celo tribe.png

West Africa where I come from is endowed with a lot of brilliant minds and the youth generation is fast evolving.
This lead me to come up with the ‘Tribe’ movement which is “a web3 social club dedicated to inspiring, educating, and exposing youths in higher institutions to the vast opportunities in Web3 building a fully functional community of young minds in Web3.”
Social clubs in higher institutions or universities are not entirely a new thing and some clubs go as far back as the 90s.

Below are a few schools with lists of registered clubs in their schools:
[Nile University](https://www.nileuniversity.edu.ng/clubs-and-activities/)
[UI University of Ibadan](https://www.ui.edu.ng/listofregisteredclubsandsocieties)
[Covenenant university UNESCO](https://covenantuniversity.edu.ng/information/more/covenant-news/407-unesco-youth-club-covenant-chapter-commences-operations)
Each school consists of various departments covering many studies in sciences, education, law, engineering, medicine, and so on. we believe these fields have a role to play in web3 and we want to expose them to Celo.

## Traction:
A few months back we held the first-ever Tribe event and we planted the first club cell which was tagged “Tribe LASUTH 1". Currently, we have about 20 active members in the club all discussing web3 and possible infusion into their field of study which happens to be medicine. check out this blog post on medium.

## Goal:
Our goal is to engage and directly chart the course of these potential young people to a future in web3 and Celo.
In achieving this, we have decided to pioneer this social club community titled: Celo Tribe which we look to establish in universities across West Africa focused on empowering these youths with the right information to harness their skills and groom them to their fullest potential exposing them to Celo and the possibilities of building in Celo.

Our initial target region is West Africa Nigeria and, her total number of universities was estimated at over 170 schools to date with Lagos State estimated to have over 11 universities inclusive of privately-owned schools.

We look to establish Celo Tribe in these schools over the next 5 months duration.

Lagos State Polytechnic

## Tribe monthly curriculum Schedule
Seminars:- Seminars will be hosted Bi-monthly where web3 facilitators/enthusiasts from around Africa will be invited to discuss with the students.
School activities:- Bi-weekly meetings will hold as they discuss weekly topics in the course outline presented to the tribal leaders in each school.
Competitions:- These will hold monthly or Bi-monthly depending on their school syllabus and school activities.
Events:- These will be organized monthly by students with catchy themes each month.
Reports:- Reports will be presented by school tribal leaders on a monthly bases for follow-ups and to see better approaches and implementations.

## Celo Tribe Social
We will be taking this a step further by creating social channels which students can follow and get up-to-date information on tribe activities done in other schools to inspire them about what they could do in their Tribe community. We will be setting up social pages on these platforms:
Twitter
Telegram
Discord (Tribe Channel)
Instagram
Also frequent blog posts on blaqk stereo as well as medium will be implemented

## Comparison
Concider Celo Tribe the "pre-workout", The regional Daos are the "sprint". The Celo African Regional Dao proposal from what I understand Hackathons based focus project. However, Our goals differ slightly as "Celo tribe" isn’t focused on hackathons even though each school will have frequent “events and seminars”, Our focus is majorly on providing information, educating, learning, and sharing. Charting the course of these potential young people to a future in web3 and Celo. An interschool hackathon can definitely be fixed in which participants from each school will be welcomed to showcase their innovations. I believe for this particular kind of events, we could reach out to the Celo's Regional Daos to support as Celo Tribe grows.

## Strategy For Regions outside Africa
Within due course, we will be reaching out by sending out letters to  various schools and institutions in other continents and we will be working closely with the Regional Daos of these continents to find out the best approach to make in regards the establishment of Celo Tribe clubs in their schools.

## P.S
Added in this pull is a snippet of the course outline and the 20 topics that will be discussed in the clubs.

Thanks.

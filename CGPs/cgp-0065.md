**MOBIUS GOVERNANCE WAS COMPROMISED. FUNDS APPEAR TO BE SAFE BUT SWAPPING FEES ARE BEING DIVERTED:** https://twitter.com/mobiusmoney/status/1604288335035322368?s=20&t=0JbG9ZR-IsJoZUemS2W-bA
**IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED TO VOTE "NO" ON THIS PROPOSAL. ANOTHER CGP THAT SUGGESTS TO DEPLOY LIQUIDITY TO CURVE INSTEAD IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED, SEE:** https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-cgp-61-on-chain-68-governance-owned-cusd-usdc-liquidity/4036/20


# Overview

[CGP #61](https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-cgp-61-on-chain-68-governance-owned-cusd-usdc-liquidity/4036) suggested to deploy protocol-owned cUSD-USDCet liquidity via Mobius. More precisely, [CGP #61](https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-cgp-61-on-chain-68-governance-owned-cusd-usdc-liquidity/4036) created a constant sum market maker (“CSMM”) StableSwap Pool via Mobius in which the reserve provided liquidity in the form of 5M cUSD and 5M USDCet (portal). This has allowed large cUSD<->USDCet trades with minimal fees and slippage and was well received by the community. 

At this point, the pool has become rather one-sided (9.55M cUSD vs. 0.45M USDCet as of Nov. 24th, 2022) which limits its usability. The Multi-Collateral Mento upgrade, which is expected to hit Celo mainnet at the end of Jan 2023, will allow direct transfers of cUSD against non-CELO reserve collateral like USDC and can be assumed to drastically improve the liquidity of Mento stables. To bridge the remaining time until Multi-Collateral Mento is live, this proposal suggests to refill the Mobius pool with an additional 10M USDCet (portal). 

## Current State of the Pool

The cUSD<-> USDCet Mobius pool was deployed in preparation of CGP #61 and can be found [here](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/address/0xFa3df877F98ac5ecd87456a7AcCaa948462412f0/transactions). As of creation of this proposal (Nov. 24, 2022), the pool holds 9.55M cUSD and 0.45M USDCet. The pool was created with the following parameters.

Under the assumption that the pool will stay roughly as one-sided as it currently is, adding 10M USDCet as suggested in this proposal will lead to a balanced 20M USD pool with approximately 10M cUSD and 10M USDCet respectively.

## Deployment

### Steps and Timing

It was anticipated in [CGP #61](https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-cgp-61-on-chain-68-governance-owned-cusd-usdc-liquidity/4036) that there might be a desire to add additional USDCet to the pool in the future and the mechanics of how this could be conducted were already laid out in the [adding USDC section](https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-cgp-61-on-chain-68-governance-owned-cusd-usdc-liquidity/4036#adding-usdc-18) of the original CGP.  The required steps and their timing are as follows:

</p>

Phase I is self-explanatory. Phase II is more complex and entails the following steps:
1. Transfer from USDC from Custodian to the 4/6 GnosisSafe Multisig 
2. Propose USD.approve(BRIDGE_ADDRESS, USDC_AMOUNT) from the GnosisSafe
3. MultiSig owners confirm and execute
4. Propose depositing USDC in the bridge from GnosisSafe
5. MultiSig owners confirm and execute
6. Redeem bridged USDC on Celo, which transfers them to Governance

As during execution of CGP #61, a multisig is required to orchestrate the bridging of USDC from the reserve in Phase II via Wormhole/Portal. This proposal suggest to use the same 4/6 multisig (GnosisSafe) on Ethereum as in CGP #61 with one change in terms of membership, that is @martinvol (clabs) taking the slot of @m-chrzan (cLabs):

* @bowd (Mento)

* @Nadiem (Mento)

* @roman (Mento)

* @nraghuveera (Celo Foundation)

* @nimittank (cLabs)

* @martinvol (clabs)

The Portal UI has a limitation: you can’t specify the recipient when bridging tokens from Ethereum to Celo, it must be the same address as the sender, but they provide a [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/certusone/wormhole/tree/dev.v2/sdk/js#ethereum-to-solana-1) that can be used to orchestrate the transfer. As in CGP #61, the following scripts will be used for steps (2) and (4) respectively :
* [approve.ts](https://github.com/bowd/bridge-script/blob/main/approve.ts)
* [bridge.ts](https://github.com/bowd/bridge-script/blob/main/bridge.ts)

In Phase III, the USDC bridged and that were sent to the governance contract via the above steps are deposited into [Mobius Pool](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/address/0xFa3df877F98ac5ecd87456a7AcCaa948462412f0/transactions). Because the deposit is conducted by the governance contract, the LP tokens will remain with governance. More precisely, in Phase III, the following transactions are supposed to be executed

1. Approve USDC transfers:
**{USDC_wormhole}**.approve(**{pool}**, **{USDC_amount}**)

2. Deposit USDCet:
**{pool}**.addLiquidity(**{amounts}**, **{minLPTokensToMint}**, **{deadline}**)

This proposal suggested the following parameters related to these transactions:

# Verification

## Before exection

Before approving/voting: Fetch the on-chain proposal and verify that the changes proposed above match the changes proposed on-chain:

```

celocli governance:show --proposalID XX --node https://forno.celo.org

```
  
### Transactions
This governance proposal results in the two transactions. Both transaction should be checked for the correctness of their parameters.

#### 1. USDC.approve
In order to deposit liquidity in the pool we first need to allow the pool to transfer tokens from governance. The parameters of this call are the pool address and the amount to set approval for:
  
The [USDC contract](https://celoscan.io/address/0x37f750B7cC259A2f741AF45294f6a16572CF5cAd#code) can be verified on-chain.

The parameters should be:

- *pool* - The Mobius pool address: 0xFa3df877F98ac5ecd87456a7AcCaa948462412f0

- *USDC_amount* - The amount of USDC to deposit with 6 decimals: 1e13

> The number of decimals for USDC can be verified [here](https://celoscan.io/token/0x37f750B7cC259A2f741AF45294f6a16572CF5cAd) on the token page (it says 6 decimals), or by reading the contract.

#### 2. Pool.addLiquidity

Adding liquidity to the pool requires to set three parameters:

- *amounts* - The amounts to add as an array. The order of this array depends on the indices in the pool, in this case the cUSD amount first and then the USDCet amount. Number of decimals is 18 for cUSD and 6 for USDCet. Providing 0 cUSD and 10M USDCet to the pool thus leads to the array: [0, 1e13]

- *minLPTokensToMint* - The slippage parameters, that is the minimum amount of LP tokens to be minted as a result of the deposit: 0 
> One can safely set minLPTokensToMint to 0 in the case of a constant sum market maker like the one used in the target pool

- *deadline* - The deadline after which the transactions expires in unix epoch time format can be checked [here](https://www.epochconverter.com/) by converting the date 28 February 2023 12:00:00 which yields: 1677542400

## After execution

- Verify that the cUSD/USDCet pool on Mobius has received 0 cUSD and 10M USDC from the governance contract.

- Verify that the governance contract has received approx. 10M LP tokens from the cUSD/USDCet pool
  
# Risks

## Bridge risks

Bridging 10M reserve USDC to Celo via Portal/Wormhole exposes the reserve to a 10M USD bridge risk. In the worst case, the 10M native USDC of the reserve could get lost due to a bridge hack, rendering the USDCet on Celo worthless.

## Contract risk

The proposed solution relies on a Mobius liquidity pool. In case of a Mobius failure or attack the deposited amount of USDCet is at risk.

## cUSD/USDC Price Risk

The setup of the liquidity pool is based on the assumption that the cUSD/USDC price is 1 - to be more precise that the cUSD/USDCet price is 1. Two market scenarios can have unwanted consequences:

1. USDC/USD price deviation from 1,
2. USDCet/USD price deviation from 1.

The cUSD/USDCet pool will offer cUSD (and USDCet) at an incorrect price that is either higher (cUSD/USDCet < 1) or lower (cUSD/USDCet > 1) than the market price. The availability of expensive/cheap liquidity can have a price impact that is undesirable for cUSD as it is purely caused by a USDCet price deviation.

## Arbitrage

As after the initial deployment of the pool, arbitrageurs might take advantage of cUSD/USDCet arbitrage opportunities potentially. In the current market situation (cUSD/USDC price at ~0.995 ), arbitrageurs are likely to buy cUSD below 1 USD in the market and sell it to the Mobius pool for a cUSD/USDCet price of  1. As long as USDC/USD stays at 1, the reserve will always be able to unwind without a net loss - irrespective of whether arbitrageurs take arbitrage opportunities or not. This is because exchanges happen 1:1 and therefore changes in reserve debt (1 USD per cUSD) and changes in reserve collateral cancel each other out.

## Overview 
- CGP-0153: CeloColombia DAO - Funding and Operations Proposal
- **Authors:** @CeloColombiano & Team
- **Funding Request:** 38,000 cUSD for DAO Operations, Community Building, and $cCOP Launch

**CeloColombia DAO** is already established and actively operational. Our proposal aims to expand and educate the Colombian community about the Celo blockchain ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on preparing for the adoption of Celo Peso ($cCOP)—the forthcoming Colombian Peso stablecoin on the Celo platform.

### Status
- FINAL 

## Summary
Since October 2022, we have been deeply engaged with local communities to promote and integrate Celo technologies across Colombia. Our presence on [X (formerly Twitter](https://x.com/Celo_Col)) has grown to over 350 followers, and our Celo Colombia community and [Telegram group](https://forum.celo.org/u/celocolombiano) now include 50 active members. Additionally, we established the Celo Colombia user on the [Celo Forum](https://forum.celo.org/u/celocolombiano) over a year ago to facilitate dialogue and collaboration. Through allied initiatives like [ReFi Colombia](https://x.com/RefiColombia) and its nodes including[ ReFi Medellín](https://x.com/ReFiMedellin), we have reached more than 1,700 members, and over 300 individuals are involved in our ReFi projects.

We have organized a diverse array of activities to onboard individuals to the Celo ecosystem and the [Valora](https://valora.xyz/) wallet. These initiatives include in-person events such as mountain hikes, meetups, workshops, and interactive sessions aimed at merchants, entrepreneurs, local talent, and the broader community. Furthermore, we have introduced new talent to the Celo ecosystem through a collaboration with ReFi Colombia with English Seasons that incorporate onboarding to on-chain interactions and practical activities utilizing Celo tools.

To formalize and enhance our operations, we are seeking funding to address pending legal and operational tasks. Our focus is on fostering innovation, promoting financial inclusion, supporting sustainable development, and strategically preparing for the launch of the $cCOP stablecoin.


#### Disclaimer About CeLatam Independence
We have taken steps to ensure that CeloColombia DAO complements, rather than duplicates, the efforts of CeLatam DAO. By studying CeLatam’s Season 0 report and understanding their focus and roadmap, we aim to enhance CeLatam's broader objectives by addressing the specific local challenges and opportunities in Colombia. While CeLatam focuses on a broader regional approach, CeloColombia DAO will particularly address the needs of Colombia’s blockchain ecosystem.

As part of this effort, we will continue communication with CeLatam’s leadership, including [Cristobal Pereira](https://forum.celo.org/u/cristpereirag), to ensure that efforts are aligned and no duplication occurs.

#### Motivation
Colombia’s strong interest in cryptocurrency is held back by challenges in blockchain adoption, limiting financial inclusion. CeloColombia DAO aims to change this by boosting blockchain awareness, fostering collaboration, and encouraging business development. By partnering with government, educational institutions, and the private sector, we’ll build a supportive ecosystem. Our educational programs will empower communities and prepare a workforce ready to embrace blockchain, advancing financial inclusion across Colombia.

#### Goals

* Utilize blockchain technology and stablecoins like $cCOP to provide accessible financial solutions to the unbanked population.
* Expand the use of Celo and decentralized technologies through education and $cCOP adoption, facilitating a transition to an inclusive digital economy.
* Encourage the development of Celo-based projects by local developers and entrepreneurs in key areas like remittances and mobile payments.
* Introduce $cCOP to shield users from currency volatility, offering a stable medium for daily transactions.

What we aim to solve

* Provide digital financial alternatives accessible via mobile devices to those without traditional banking.
* Lower fees and increase efficiency in remittances and transactions using Celo and $cCOP.
* Offer $cCOP as a stable option to hedge against fluctuations of the Colombian peso.
* Rebuild trust by offering decentralized and transparent financial solutions that return control to users.
* Educate the population through workshops, hackathons, and campaigns on the benefits of blockchain technology.

#### Challenges

Despite Colombia’s significant interest in cryptocurrency and a remittance market exceeding [$10 billion in 2023](https://www.larepublica.co/economia/la-recepcion-de-remesas-alcanzo-record-de-us-10-000-millones-en-2023-3789162), several obstacles hinder the adoption of the Celo ecosystem.

Regulatory uncertainty creates hesitation among users and investors. Ambiguous legal frameworks and a lack of clear guidelines stifle innovation and participation in blockchain initiatives. This lack of clarity discourages potential stakeholders from engaging with new technologies due to fears of legal repercussions or unfavorable regulatory changes.

Security concerns and an erosion of public trust present significant challenges. Many potential users worry about the safety of digital assets and the risk of loss due to price fluctuations. These concerns are compounded by regulatory ambiguities and a history of Ponzi schemes that have defrauded thousands of Colombians over time, significantly fracturing public confidence in new financial technologies.

Additionally, the absence of tailored applications addressing local needs—such as financial inclusion for the unbanked, high transaction costs, and economic instability—limits the practical utility of blockchain technology in Colombia. Without solutions designed to tackle these specific challenges, widespread adoption remains unlikely.

CeloColombia DAO proposal aims to address these issues by adopting a structured, community-driven approach to blockchain. The DAO will emphasize education, forge partnerships, and develop Celo-based solutions tailored to the Colombian market. It will also prepare for the launch of $cCOP, ensuring its smooth integration into the local economy and utilizing remittance flows to enhance financial inclusion and drive innovation, in order to educate people about digital assets and promote its use in local businesses.

______

### Specification

CeloColombia DAO will focus on building community through a variety of initiatives, including active social media engagement, organizing local meetups, and participating in significant industry events such as Colombian Fintech Forum, and Tech Week Medellín.

The DAO will also actively seek other relevant events and opportunities within Colombia’s blockchain and fintech sectors as they arise. Moreover, it will work to establish partnerships with local businesses and stakeholders to promote the adoption and integration of Celo’s ecosystem in Colombia.

#### General Crypto adoption in Colombia

Colombia is the 15th country globally in cryptocurrency adoption and ranks among the top five in Latin America, alongside Brazil and Argentina. Monthly cryptocurrency transactions in the country reach about $70 billion, with over 600 buying and selling sites. In 2022, Colombia received $9.43 billion in remittances, ranking fourth in the region after Mexico, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.

The Colombian Central Bank (Banco de la República) stated in Concept SCD-14893 (March 30, 2023) that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, currency, securities, or financial assets equivalent to cash. Their use is permitted, enabling parties to mutually agree to conduct transactions with them. Various authorities have provided guidance on their classification:

* DIAN: Cryptocurrencies are considered intangible assets that can generate income (Concept 915014, October 14, 2022).
* Superintendency of Companies: It is lawful for companies to engage in crypto-related activities (Concept 220-139607, July 17, 2023).
* Technical Council of Public Accounting: Cryptocurrencies are assets, classifiable as inventory (IAS 2) or intangibles (IAS 38), depending on their use (Technical Orientation No. 20, June 5, 2023).

Furthermore, reflecting the growing institutional interest in digital assets, major Colombian banks are exploring the development of centralized stablecoins pegged to the Colombian peso. Notably, the largest bank in Colombia, [Bancolombia, recently announced its digital wallet Wenia ](https://www.larepublica.co/finanzas/bancolombia-anuncio-el-inicio-de-operacion-de-weina-su-negocio-de-activos-digitales-3852379)and the wCOP, a centralized stablecoin pegged to the peso. The bank aims to reach 70,000 users in the initial months following its launch, preparing for the upcoming years of technology adoption in the country. This initiative signifies a significant step towards integrating blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system. The involvement of leading financial institutions like Bancolombia may influence regulatory perspectives and enhance public trust, potentially accelerating the adoption of digital currencies across the nation.


#### Celo Current Status
Celo is actively growing in Colombia, driven by its public goods funding initiatives and focus on supporting local projects. The Celo ecosystem has allocated funds through various regional grant programs to encourage development and adoption. In early 2024, Celo initiated proposals that include funding for local projects and collaboration with global initiatives. There is ongoing support for incubating projects and enabling community-led development, showing strong engagement and growth in the Colombian market.

________

### Execution Plan

CeloColombia DAO has developed a strategic execution plan to advance the adoption of the Celo ecosystem in Colombia, with a special focus on preparing for the integration of the $cCOP stablecoin. Recognizing the significant opportunities and existing challenges within the Colombian market, our plan is designed to address key areas that will drive growth, education, and adoption.

#### Transparency in Fund Management
All funds managed through the multisig will be accompanied by a transparency system. This system will provide a clear breakdown of how funds are used and spent, ensuring responsible and transparent management of resources. Any funds left by six (6) months of operations will be returned to the Celo Community Treasury.

The system file will include information on all monthly recurring operating expenses, as well as costs associated with activities and incentives. This way, a complete overview of fund distribution and usage will be available in real time.

Additionally, periodic reports will be generated to reflect both recurring and partial results of each initiative and proposed space per month. These reports will allow for the evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of the actions taken, facilitating continuous feedback to improve future initiatives.

This strategy not only promotes transparency but also fosters trust among stakeholders, ensuring that all participants are aware of how resources are managed and what results are achieved.

This added layer of security ensures that decisions regarding fund allocation are made collaboratively. Initially, the wallet will be governed by a select team of signers who will oversee transactions and maintain transparency. As the DAO evolves, there are plans to expand governance to include more community members, fostering a sense of ownership and participation in the decision-making process. This approach not only enhances security but also strengthens community engagement and trust as the DAO grows.

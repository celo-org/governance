## Overview

The team at Mento Labs is proposing the creation of a new trading pair on Mento: cUSD/USDT. This initiative aims to support our partners at Opera Mini Pay in their mission to offer accessible financial solutions to millions of users in Africa, powered by Mento. In addition to the new pair, we also propose reducing the spread of existing USDC/cUSD pools (nativeUSDC/cUSD and axlUSDC/cUSD) to 0, to facilitate easy on-and-off ramping from other stables to cUSD.

An in-depth description of the governance proposal aimed at approvers and developers can be found in the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mento-upgrade-mu06-native-usdt-integration/8010).

## Proposed Changes

Check the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mento-upgrade-mu06-native-usdt-integration/8010) for a detailed description of the proposed changes.

## Verification

Check the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-mento-upgrade-mu06-native-usdt-integration/8010) for a detailed description of verification steps.

## Risks

This is a relatively low risk proposal as it only involves adding a new pools to the Mento v2 protocol and re-creating some of the existing pools with a similar configuration to the existing ones. The proposal has been thoroughly tested by the Mento team in testnet environments and in a Celo mainnet like fork.

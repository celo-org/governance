## Overview
This proposal seeks authorization for the second half of the [Strategic Grant](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/147) aimed at accelerating the adoption of Celo ecosystem apps in Africa. Following MiniPay's recent milestone of reaching 6 million wallet activations - each tied to a verified phone number and making it arguably one of the fastest-growing self-custodial wallets worldwide - this additional funding will be used:

* As incremental marketing budget to advertise Celo ecosystem apps within Opera products including display ads and push & in-app notifications (in addition to ongoing promotions of the MiniPay product itself)
* To expand marketing, co-marketing efforts for MiniPay and ecosystem applications.
* To aid dedicated business development efforts and point of contact with Opera product and engineering leads.

The grant will be disbursed in $CELO on a quarterly schedule. Opera intends to responsibly hold \$CELO tokens and actively engage in Celo governance, reflecting its commitment to the long-term success of the ecosystem.

## Motivation
This initiative is key to Celo's growth, offering new avenues to onboard millions of potential users, foster stablecoin utility, and deepen integrations within local economies. By leveraging Opera's extensive footprint on the continent - already proven successful with MiniPay's rapid growth - this grant will unlock the next phase of Celo's expansion into critical markets and showcase the potential of ecosystem solutions to a broad user base.

### Launch & Growth

Opera introduced MiniPay in September 2023 integrated inside of Opera Mini, one of the most popular browsers in Africa, kicking off the roll out in Nigeria and subsequently expanding to Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, and additional key markets across the continent. MiniPay launched only supporting cUSD stablecoin and grew to over 3 million wallet activations generating over 4 Million daily cUSD transactions before later adding support for both USDT and USDC stablecoins on Celo in July 2024. This update was executed with the innovative “Pockets” feature - which streamlines multi-stablecoin management, enabling users to easily swap between stablecoins seamlessly and at no extra cost - powered by Mento Protocol.

### Global Expansion
In October 2024, MiniPay expanded beyond its initial integration as a feature of the Opera  Mini browser, launching as a standalone app on Android, and expanding to 50+ more countries globally and unlocking remittance to existing users in Africa as a use case. The standalone app on Android has since surpassed 600,000 downloads on the Google Play Store and the  iOS version, currently in TestFlight, is slated for release in early 2025. With this expanded availability, MiniPay continues to broaden its global footprint, connecting users on the continent to the global economy and bringing seamless, stablecoin-based transactions to users worldwide.

### Blockchain Impact
As of today, MiniPay records over 1.5 Million monthly active wallets and 900,000 daily transactions on the Celo blockchain. Following the addition of USDT support, active USDT addresses on Celo have increased from 27,400 in July 2024 to 894,400 in January 2025 (source: Artemis)., demonstrating heightened adoption and underscoring MiniPay's pivotal role in catalyzing stablecoin usage and broader DeFi participation.

### Thought Leadership & International Coverage
MiniPay's rapid growth and innovative approach has attracted significant media attention, with major publications recognizing its impact and featuring stories on MiniPay. Moreover, industry KOLs have also commended MiniPay's user-friendly design and potential. Their endorsements underscore the broad market excitement and validate MiniPay as a true innovation in the space. Additionally, initiatives like the MiniPay Challenge have showcased real success stories from the very users participating on Celo every day.

### Celo Ecosystem Adoption

#### Expanded Payment Coverage
MiniPay now integrates 13 crypto–fiat ramps, covering over 53 countries and over 35 local currencies. Partners include Unlimit, Transak, Banxa, Ramp, Partna, Yellow Card, TransFi, Cashramp, Fonbank, Paychant, and MoonPay - ensuring a hyperlocalized experience for buying and selling stablecoins across the globe.

#### Strategic Collaborations
In addition, Opera has forged key partnerships to provide zero-fee on- and off-ramping across over 35 local currencies. These strategic alliances have eliminated traditional conversion costs, enabling users to seamlessly move funds between local currencies and stablecoins at no extra charge. This initiative not only drives increased user engagement by reducing transaction friction but also solidifies MiniPay's reputation as one of the most accessible and affordable ways to buy, sell, and spend stablecoins.

#### Empowering Celo's ecosystem of Builders

This ensures that users, regardless of local currency or location, can instantly access and interact with these ecosystem applications. Integrated Mini Apps now record over 50 million weekly impressions and 5 million weekly app opens, reflecting high user engagement and adoption.

Opera has played a pivotal role in this success by providing comprehensive product, design, marketing, and business development support, along with dedicated funding for co-marketing campaigns and promotional initiatives using Opera's owned inventory. This robust support structure has empowered external ecosystem builders to refine their offerings, reach new audiences, and leverage MiniPay's seamless infrastructure to deliver practical solutions.

## Metrics & KPIs

Opera has provided funding for co-marketing campaigns, product, design, and business development support, and in-app promotions to integrated Mini Apps. This support has helped refine their offering, reach new audiences, and leverage MiniPay's infrastructure to deliver practical solutions - spanning remittances, bill payments, gaming, education, and more. Below are externally built Mini Apps that exemplify the impact of these efforts, followed by Opera-incubated apps that further enrich the MiniPay user experience.

### Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: Donate
The Donate Mini App,  integrated within MiniPay in December 2024 is making donations more accessible. Launched first in December 2024, and currently featuring Code Yetu  and WeThinkCode - 2 local NGOs from Kenya and South Africa respectively. The Donate app has since facilitated over 12,000 donations by leveraging MiniPay's robust, borderless payment infrastructure. The app allows these local charities to receive contributions in stablecoins from donors in over 53 countries, eliminating traditional barriers and high fees.

This streamlined donation process not only increases the reach of local charities but also enhances transparency and efficiency in fund transfers. The success of the Donate App underscores MiniPay's ability to drive real-world impact through decentralized financial solutions, enabling charitable organizations to access a global donor base and receive support quickly and cost-effectively.

#### Case Study 2: BitGifty
BitGifty's evolution is a shining example of how access to a global distribution network can redefine a service. Originating from the Celo Camp Batch 8, Opera worked with the BitGifty team, advising on product, design, and marketing, eventually finding it a home inside of  MiniPay at the end of March 2024\. Today, BitGifty is a thriving platform that has facilitated over 400,000 local bill payments - from electricity and airtime to data and cable subscriptions - across Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Uganda. BitGifty not only simplifies everyday payments with stablecoins but has also benefitted from Opera-facilitated strategic partnerships and funded co-marketing campaigns to offer zero-fees and cashback on local bills paid, further expanding its reach and driving adoption by local users.

#### Case Study 3: Mdundo
Mdundo, a culturally tailored music streaming service, launched within MiniPay with a focus on affordability and local relevance. Offering a free three-day trial and subscription plans starting as low as $0.50, Mdundo quickly captured the market - amassing over 20,000 subscribed users in the first few days going live. This rapid adoption underscores MiniPay's unique ability to empower innovative solutions that meet the everyday needs of users, bridging digital finance and entertainment. Mdundo's success demonstrates how a robust, borderless ecosystem can drive engagement and unlock opportunities in sectors that directly resonate with local communities

#### Case Study 4: MENTO
Mento Labs, the team behind the cUSD stablecoin  also launched a Mini App to drive engagement for cUSD stablecoins among MiniPay users through two airdrop campaigns. Leveraging MiniPay's frictionless and localized cash-in/cash-out experience and user-friendly send flow,  Mento  quickly accelerated token distribution, with the second season fully allocating 10 million $MENTO tokens two weeks ahead of schedule - demonstrating rapid adoption and reinforcing stablecoin usage across the ecosystem.

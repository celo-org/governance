## Overview 
 
CGP Number: 146 enables the integration of chainlink rate feeds into the SortedOracles contract.

With this Mento Upgrade a Chainlink Relayer contract is introduced. 
The ChainlinkRelayer relays rate feed data from a Chainlink price feed or an aggregation of multiple Chainlink price feeds to the SortedOracles contract. 
This contract can aggregate multiple Chainlink price feeds to provide derived rate feeds to the rest of the protocol. This is needed because it is more efficient for Oracle providers to report FX rates against the dollar and crypto-asset rates against the dollar, instead of all possible combinations.

 
## Proposed Changes
 
Check the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/mu07-chainlink-price-feed-integration/8850) for a detailed description of the proposed changes.
 
## Verification
 
Check the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/mu07-chainlink-price-feed-integration/8850) for a detailed description of verification steps.
 
## Risks
 
The data relayed by the ChainlinkRelayer contract is only as secure as the Chainlink price feeds it relies on. If the Chainlink price feeds are compromised, the data relayed by the ChainlinkRelayer contract could be manipulated. This could lead to the SortedOracles contract reporting incorrect rate feeds to the rest of the protocol. 

This risk is present with all Oracle solution and is not specific to the Chainlink price feeds. In order to mitigate this risk, the Mento Protocol has implemented onchain circuit breakers that automatically pause the protocol if the reported data is outside of a predefined threshold. As well as our onchain trading limits, which limit the trading bandwidth.

## Overview 
 
CGP Number: 146 enables the integration of chainlink rate feeds into the SortedOracles contract.

With this Mento Upgrade a Chainlink Relayer contract is introduced. 
The ChainlinkRelayer relays rate feed data from a Chainlink price feed or an aggregation of multiple Chainlink price feeds to the SortedOracles contract. 
This contract can aggregate multiple Chainlink price feeds to provide derived rate feeds to the rest of the protocol. This is needed because it is more efficient for Oracle providers to report FX rates against the dollar and crypto-asset rates against the dollar, instead of all possible combinations.

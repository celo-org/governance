**Short description:**

We seek funding to promote Celo adoption among creatives and establish a vibrant & interconnected creatives community on the Celo ecosystem.
This community will foster an atmosphere that encourages open discussions and collaborations on cutting-edge web3 tech solutions that address real-world challenges, particularly in the entertainment space.
Our initiative aims to facilitate cooperative efforts, support artistic expression, and encourage tokenization as we educate and encourage creatives to interact with dApps and build on web3 even as they explore leveraging DeFi and Refi to gain financial autonomy, broader access to capital, and the ability to monetize their creativity in innovative ways.
Your support will help bring this vision to life as we bridge the gap between creative arts and web3 on CELO.

[details="Introduction :"]
I am Shola, a creative director/artist with a decade of global collaboration experience. I am passionate about bridging the gap between creative art and the decentralised web. Leveraging web3 and the CELO ecosystem, I believe we can revolutionize art expression. My web3 journey started 2 years ago when I was opportune to served as a council in Blaqk Stereo DAO, and since my time there we have achieved some remarkable milestones amongst which is a Guinness World Record with [@hawwal](https://forum.celo.org/u/hawwal) as team lead.

[Guinness world record publication](https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/nigerian-actor-hawwal-ogungbadero-others-set-guinness-world-record/pmwm790#:~:text=Nigerian%20actor%2Dcum%2Dentrepreneur%2C,of%20the%20Guinness%20World%20Record)

**Challenge Definition:**
* In recent times, The market for creative art NFTs on platforms like OpenSea sees a weekly trading volume in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. This trend reflects the growing integration of blockchain technology with music and arts. The ERC20 blockchain has emerged as a frontrunner in enabling the tokenisation of creativity, offering new possibilities for artists and listeners alike. However, there is still room for expansion and we intend to explore every sector of arts and entertainment to reach out to a broader scope of artist and creatives alike.

* The absence of a dedicated creative community within the Celo ecosystem is a noticeable gap in the decentralised finance landscape. While Celo has made significant strides in promoting financial inclusion, a dedicated platform for creative artists is lacking. Such a community could enable artists to showcase and sell their work, connect with patrons, and receive fair compensation for their creative endeavours. This could encourage the exploration of new means and tech solutions to every day challenges faced in real time by creatives and corporations alike. By incorporating a place for creatives, Celo could further expand its user base, foster artistic expression, and contribute to the overall vibrancy and diversity of the ecosystem.

**CXA: CELO X ART**
Our team, actively working in the Celo ecosystem, is coming together with our skills, knowledge, and network to bridge this gap through an initiative called CELO X ART (CXA).
CXA was created from these two separate words “Celo” and “Art”.
CXA : Celo X Art is a creatives community within the Celo community where artist from diverse backgrounds and fields can build and grow exponentially within the Celo ecosystem.

**Objective:**

* With the intention to finance celo-based projects with creative ingenuity, we plan to Host a series of events, starting with art competitions as awareness and empowerment campaigns, and concurrently, series of workshop trainings that’ll educate the contestants with adequate knowledge of celo protocols, opportunities & advantages of interacting with block chain technology for expression & tokenization of arts and jointly onboarding & integrating them with our dApps and marketplaces.
Our goal is to onboard creatives from every country as our target Is to establish celo creative ambassadors in all regions as each representative will be an agent propagating the adoption of celo amongst creatives locally as they expand the celo community. This preliminary project should facilitate the building & testing of structure/framework for the establishment and management of the CELO X ART DAO.

**Goals:**
* Fostering collaborations among artists, harnessing their creative ingenuity to develop dApps solutions that address real-life challenges in the entertainment industry.
* Empowering emerging talents in the underground scene , cultivating a new wave of active exceptional web3-based creatives.
* Increase community network by Expanding the scope of membership on the celo ecosystem
* Forge partnerships with other art-focused organizations, institutions to expand the community's reach and impact.
* boosting activity and engagement of new and existing celo stake holders in eco system & affiliate NFT market place like tofuNFT,ARI Gallery etc

**Strategy & Process:**

CXA phase 1 project plans to kick off with two prominent events in Africa to host a diverse range of artists, one in Nigeria and the other in South Africa. They aim to engage artists through a grassroots approach, directly networking with creatives from diverse backgrounds. The events will showcase the cultural richness of the regions and encourage the utilization of dApps with exclusive privileges.
The strategy begins with online competitions in different cities and selected finalists will compete in the host nations. presentations will be web3 inclined and show great potential to win sponsorship.
After the contest, winners will receive rewards through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and credibility. Thereafter, participants will undergo a comprehensive workshop training, empowering them to establish Celo communities across Africa.

**Side note:**
1. Approximately 460 million Africans, constituting one-third of the continent’s population, live in extreme poverty. Given Africa’s population of around 1.4 billion, Celo’s mission of prosperity for all is particularly crucial, necessitating a focused approach to effectively expand its impact in the African region.
2. The DAO's primary focus is shifting towards supporting young and talented individuals outside traditional academia. Many of these individuals have honed their creative art skills without pursuing a university education. The DAO aims to empower this distinct group, providing opportunities for them to harness their artistic talents and reach their full potential.

**Projected Impact:**
* Increased Adoption and Visibility: As the initiative brings creatives from diverse backgrounds into the Celo ecosystem, it can lead to increased adoption and visibility for the platform. This can attract attention from investors, developers, and other stakeholders, further driving ecosystem growth.
* Enhanced Token Utility: By empowering creatives to tokenize their art and creative works on the Celo blockchain, the utility of the Celo token can expand. token will play crucial role in facilitating transactions, NFT minting, and other activities within the artistic community thereby increasing its demand, liquidity & value.
* Expanded Ecosystem: The initiative's goal of cultivating a vibrant and interconnected community of creatives can lead to a more extensive and engaged ecosystem on the Celo blockchain. This can attract new projects, collaborations, and users, strengthening the overall Celo ecosystem.
* Innovation and Creativity: The focus on encouraging discussions and collaborations for developing cutting-edge web3 tech solutions to real-world challenges in the entertainment space can spur innovation and creativity. This, in turn, can attract developers and technologists to build solutions on the Celo platform, enhancing its ecosystem with new and exciting applications.
* Social Impact: Empowering creatives through the Celo ecosystem can have a broader social impact by supporting artists, promoting cultural diversity, and facilitating greater financial inclusion for creatives globally.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
 **Budget:** We request 215,808 CELO equivalent to $90,000 (At the time of correcting this proposal) for the next five months (July - November 2023). I, Shola, a creative director/artist, have spearheaded an initiative called CELO X ART (CXA) with my team. Our primary objective is to bridge the gap between creatives and the web3 space. This two-phase project aims to empower creative artists and establish a thriving community for them within the CELO ecosystem, enabling them to express their art without limitations.
Phase 1 of the project involves hosting two contests in Nigeria and South Africa, where participants will compete for prizes. In addition to the contest, contestants will undergo a comprehensive workshop training that will familiarize them with the CELO ecosystem and its DApps. They will be educated on how to integrate their art into the ecosystem and engage with CELO’s marketplaces. This phase serves as the initial step in integrating creatives into the CELO ecosystem.
Phase 2 focuses on the establishment of the CXA DAO. The CXA DAO aims to empower creatives within the CELO ecosystem, fostering growth and prosperity among artists worldwide. The introduction of the CXA DAO will take place in the second season of the project, enabling creatives to actively participate in decision-making processes and contribute to the development of the community.
As part of our future plans, we envision expanding the CXA initiative beyond Africa and into other continents. By embracing creatives from diverse backgrounds, we aim to create a global network of artists within the CELO ecosystem, facilitating collaboration and mutual growth.
Through CELO X ART (CXA), we are dedicated to unlocking the full potential of creatives in the web3 space, providing them with a platform to showcase their talents and thrive in a supportive community.

# Overview
[CGP #61](https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-cgp-61-on-chain-68-governance-owned-cusd-usdc-liquidity/4036) suggested to deploy protocol-owned cUSD-USDCet liquidity via Mobius. More precisely, [CGP #61](https://forum.celo.org/t/discussion-cgp-61-on-chain-68-governance-owned-cusd-usdc-liquidity/4036) created a constant sum market maker (“CSMM”) StableSwap Pool via Mobius in which the reserve provided liquidity in the form of 5M cUSD and 5M USDCet (portal). This has allowed large cUSD<->USDCet trades with minimal fees and slippage and was well received by the community. Since the pool became rather one-sided, it was recently suggested to [refill the pool with and additional 10M USDC](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/79).

On December 16th, Mobius governance was compromised. Funds appear to be safe as governance power is very limited in the Mobius setup but swapping fees of the Mento-owned cUSD<->USDC liquidity are currently being diverted. More details on the Mobius situation can be found [here](https://twitter.com/mobiusmoney/status/1604288335035322368?s=20&t=0JbG9ZR-IsJoZUemS2W-bA).

In light of these developments, it appears to be prudent to move liquidity out of Mobius.  [Curve recently launched on Celo](https://twitter.com/CeloOrg/status/1595056697319399424?s=20&t=6nd-LQy5Wa83GI2lFdaTCw) and it is, due to its focus on StableSwap pools, a natural and battle-tested alternative to Mobius. This proposal therefore suggests to move the Mento-owned cUSD<->USDC liquidity currently deposited to Mobius over to an equivalent Curve pool and deposit the top-up of 10M additional Mento Reserve USDC suggested in [CGP #79](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/79) to this Curve pool as well.


## Deployment

### Steps and Timing

</p>

**Phase I**
Phase I involves the following steps:
1. Set up GenosisSafe multisig on Ethereum (GSE)
2. Set up GenosisSafe multisig on Celo (GSC)
3. Deploy a cUSD<->USDCet Curve Pool on Celo
4. Submit this CGP on chain

**Phase II** 
Phase II (on-chain execution) is only reached if the proposal gets accepted via on-chain governance.
 1. Withdraw cUSD and USDCet liquidity from the cUSD<->USDCet Mobius pool via on-chain governance.
 2. Create allowances for the GSC multisig to transfer the cUSD and USDCet withdrawn in step one. The exact amounts withdrawn in step one are uncertain as they depend on the pool balances at time of execution. Therefore, allowances are set to 11M which covers all cases. The GSC multisig is instructed to only transfer the amounts withdrawn in step 1 even if the allowances created exceed these amounts.

**Phase III**
Phase III involves the following actions by the involved multisigs (GSE and GSC):
1. Transfer cUSD and USDC from governance to GSC.
2. Transfer USDC from reserve custodian to GSE.
3. Bridge 10M USDC from Ethereum to Celo via Wormhole using GSE.
4. Deposit ~20M USD worth of USDCet and cUSD into the cUSD<->USDCet Curve Pool via GSC.
5. Transfer the cUSD<->USDCet Curve LPTokens to the governance proxy via GSC.

The Portal UI has a limitation: you can’t specify the recipient when bridging tokens from Ethereum to Celo, it must be the same address as the sender, but they provide a [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/certusone/wormhole/tree/dev.v2/sdk/js#ethereum-to-solana-1) that can be used to orchestrate the transfer. As in [CGP #68](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/68), the following scripts will be used for steps (2) and (3) of Phase III:

* [approve.ts](https://github.com/bowd/bridge-script/blob/main/approve.ts)
* [bridge.ts](https://github.com/bowd/bridge-script/blob/main/bridge.ts)

This proposal suggests to use a 4/6 multisig on Ethereum (GSE) and a 4/6 multisig on Celo (GSC), both with the following members:
* @rcroessmann
* @bowd
* @aleksey-nov
* @sissnad
* @sudarics
* @olektronisch

# Verification

## Before execution

 
Before approving/voting: Fetch the on-chain proposal and verify that the changes proposed above under Phase II (see also first parameters table) match the changes submitted to chain:
```
celocli governance:show --proposalID XX --node https://forno.celo.org
```

### Transactions

The execution of this governance proposal results in four transactions. These transaction should be checked for the correctness of its parameters and are described below. The remaining steps (see Phase I and Phase III) are then conducted via the GSC and GSE multisigs.

#### 1. mobiusPoolLPTokenAddress.approve

Allows the Mobius pool contract to transfer Mobius pool token held with governance. This is needed prior to withdrawal of liquidity.

The [Mobius cUSD/USDCet LPToken contract](https://celoscan.io/address/0x552b9AA0eEe500c60f09456e49FBc1096322714C#code) is not verified on chain by the Mobius team but *approve* has been called on these tokens in the past.

The parameters of this approve transaction should be:
-  *mobiusPoolLPTokenAddress* - The Mobius LPToken contract address: `0x552b9AA0eEe500c60f09456e49FBc1096322714C`
-  *mobiusPool* - Address of the Mobius cUSD/USDCet pool contract: `0xFa3df877F98ac5ecd87456a7AcCaa948462412f0`
-  *mobiusLPTokensToTransfer* - The amount of LPTokens to allow, with 18 decimals. In this case 10M * 1e18 = 1e25: `10000000000000000000000000`

 #### 2. mobiusPool.removeLiquidity

Withdraws liquidity from the Mobius pool.

The parameters of this transfer transaction should be:
-  *mobiusPool* - Address of the Mobius cUSD/USDCet pool contract: `0xFa3df877F98ac5ecd87456a7AcCaa948462412f0`
-  *mobiusLPTokensToWithdraw* - The amount of LPTokens to withdraw, with 18 decimals. In this case 10M * 1e18 = 1e25: `10000000000000000000000000`
-  *mobiusMinAmounts* - Minimum amounts to withdraw - can be safely set to 0: `[0, 0]`
-  *mobiusDeadline* - Deadline until which withdrawal needs to complete, in epoch time. Translates to January 28, 2023 5:28:04 AM GMT. Every timestamp far enough into the future would do: `1674883684`

 #### 3. cusdAddress.approve

Creates an approval for the GSC multisig to withdraw cUSD from the governance proxy.

The parameters of this transfer transaction should be:
-  *cusdAddress* - Address of the cUSD contract: `0x765de816845861e75a25fca122bb6898b8b1282a`
-  *gscAddress* - Address of the GSC multisig: `0x87647780180B8f55980C7D3fFeFe08a9B29e9aE1`
-  *cusdAllowanceAmount* - The amount of cUSD to allow, with 18 decimals. In this case 11M * 1e18 = 11e24: `11000000000000000000000000`

#### 4. usdcWormhole.approve

Creates an approval for the GSC multisig to withdraw wormhole USDC from the governance proxy.

The parameters of this transfer transaction should be:
-  *usdcWormhole* - Address of the USDC wormhole contract: `0x37f750B7cC259A2f741AF45294f6a16572CF5cAd`
-  *gscAddress* - Address of the GSC multisig: `0x87647780180B8f55980C7D3fFeFe08a9B29e9aE1`
-  *usdcAllowanceAmount* - The amount of cUSD to allow, with 6 decimals. In this case 11M * 1e6 = 11e12: `11000000000000`

## After Phase II (on-chain execution)
- Verify that the *governanceProxy* has received roughly 10M USD worth of cUSD and USDCet.
- Verify that the *gscAddress* has received an allowance for 11M cUSD and 11M wormhole USDC.

## After Phase III
- Verify that the *CurvePoolAddress* has received ~20M USD worth of USDCet and cUSD - the exact split will depend on the Mobius pool balance at time of liquidity withdrawal.
- Verify that the governance proxy has received ~20M Curve cUSD/USDCet LPTokens.

# Risk
## Bridge risks
Bridging another 10M reserve USDC to Celo via Portal/Wormhole exposes the reserve to a 10M USD bridge risk. In the worst case, the 10M native USDC of the reserve could get lost due to a bridge hack, rendering the USDCet on Celo worthless.

## Contract risk
The proposed solution relies on a Curve liquidity pool. In case of a Curve failure or attack the deposited amounts of cUSD and USDCet are at risk.

## cUSD/USDC Price Risk
The setup of the liquidity pool is based on the assumption that the cUSD/USDC price is 1 - to be more precise that the cUSD/USDCet price is 1. Two market scenarios can have unwanted consequences:
1. USDC/USD price deviation from 1,
2. USDCet/USD price deviation from 1.

The cUSD/USDCet pool will offer cUSD (and USDCet) at an incorrect price that is either higher (cUSD/USDCet < 1) or lower (cUSD/USDCet > 1) than the market price. The availability of expensive/cheap liquidity can have a price impact that is undesirable for cUSD as it is purely caused by a USDCet price deviation.

## Arbitrage
As after the initial deployment of the pool, arbitrageurs might take advantage of cUSD/USDCet arbitrage opportunities potentially. In the current market situation (cUSD/USDC price at ~0.995 ), arbitrageurs are likely to buy cUSD below 1 USD in the market and sell it to the Mobius pool for a cUSD/USDCet price of 1. As long as USDC/USD stays at 1, the reserve will always be able to unwind without a net loss - irrespective of whether arbitrageurs take arbitrage opportunities or not. This is because exchanges happen 1:1 and therefore changes in reserve debt (1 USD per cUSD) and changes in reserve collateral cancel each other out.

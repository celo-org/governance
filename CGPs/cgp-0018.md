## Overview

This CGP is an effort to facillitate voter engagement in Celo governance by extending the `referendumStageDuration` -- the length of time during which Celo holders may vote on a proposal after it has been approved.

We propose an increase in the `referendumStageDuration` from `432000` (5 days) to `604800` (7 days). The decision to raise the value to 7 days is informed by the work cadence of key Celo holders whose participation must be coordinated in order to pass proposals.

## Proposed Changes

1. Set `referendumStageDuration` to `604800`

- Destination: Governance [setReferendumStageDuration](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/Governance.sol#L319)
- Data: 604800 (7 days in seconds)
- Value: 0

## Verification

1. Confirm proposal: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID <proposalID>`
2. Confirm Execution: run `celocli network:parameters --node https://forno.celo.org`

## Risks

Extending the `referendumStageDuration` will prolong to the time it takes to pass a proposal and may delay important updates. However, being able to easily coordinate enough votes to pass a proposal is currently a larger barrier to protocol updates.

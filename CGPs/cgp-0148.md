# Overview

Dear Celo Community,

We are thrilled to propose a revised proposal for the development of the Application Activity Monitor, a critical dashboard for institutional investors looking to deploy capital in ecosystems, and a comprehensive suite of stablecoin-focused dashboards by Artemis. We heard the community feedback loud and clear and are focusing this new proposal on 2 major changes:

1. **Reducing the cost to US$175k total** ($100k reduction). We are asking for cUSD instead of Celo to **reduce sell pressure on CELO** and most of our expenses are in USD.

2. Focusing on a suite of new public good dashboards for ecosystem projects and stablecoins that **benefits the whole Celo ecosystem rather than for Stabila**. Specifically:
    * Best-in-class stablecoin dashboards and information pages the Celo community can rely on to track key stablecoin KPIs and make data-driven decisions.
    * Put Celo **front and center of the stablecoin conversations and developments** since our stablecoin analytics is trusted by the industry such as [Jeremy Allaire (Circle Founder and CEO)](https://twitter.com/artemis__xyz/status/1829517423583936741), [Cuy Sheffield (Visa Head of Digital Assets)](https://twitter.com/cuysheffield/status/1829596803987280108), [Katie Haun (Coinbase Board of Directors)](https://twitter.com/ahnchrisj/status/1829194525551812645), Apple, Visa, PayPal, Tether and more.

In addition, Artemis will:

1. Keep all dashboards free and open: Artemis champions free, open, and transparent crypto data and commits to keeping our dashboards free forever.
2. Work closely with the community, Celo Foundation, and Mento to continuously maintain the dashboard.

### Status

- DRAFT

# Abstract

Artemis, a data provider trusted by top investors like Pantera, Dragonfly, Grayscale, VanEck, Coinfund, and Franklin Templeton, proposes to build open-source dashboards for the Celo ecosystem. These dashboards will highlight stablecoin and dapp activity, and showcase Celo’s recent growth. Our institutional-grade data aids major investors in key decisions, and these public goods will improve Celo’s transparency and visibility with institutional investors–allowing for potential future investments in the ecosystem.

We are seeking funding in cUSD to support the development and operation of two key tools:

- **[Free public good] Stablecoin Dashboard Suite**:
-- 1. Provide comprehensive tracking and analysis of stablecoin activities on the Celo platform.
-- 2. Stablecoin project pages to showcase the different stablecoins on Celo so viewers can understand Celo's unique offerings.

- **[Free public good] Application Activity Monitor**: The Application Activity Monitor tracks dapp usage on Celo, highlighting trending applications in its ecosystem. This tool enables investors, ecosystem builders, and blockchain foundations to assess the health of their chain's dapp ecosystem. Consequently, they can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and attention to foster further growth. Institutional investors prioritize understanding on-chain activity within an ecosystem before making investments.

# Motivation

## Stablecoin Dashboard Suite

Stablecoins are a primary growth driver for Celo and so is a critical focus for the ecosystem. Being a stablecoin chain enables Celo to differentiate itself from other L1s and L2s and drives towards Celo’s mission of enabling financial access and prosperity for all.

As a result, it is essential for the Celo ecosystem to track and analyze stablecoin activity so data driven decisions can be made on how to further grow Celo. Furthermore, it is essential for Celo to show off all the traction it has made in the recent months so that institutional investors can get excited about the ecosystem.

### A. Stablecoin V3

Artemis is building a new version of the stablecoin dashboard. This new version of the dashboard incorporates feedback from all important KOLs of stablecoin data including from folks like Solana Foundation and Circle.

### B. Project Pages for every Celo stablecoin

Artemis is proposing landing pages for Celo issued stables that allows anyone interested in stablecoins to better understand Celo stablecoins. This contract will allow Artemis to keep adding new pages for new Celo stables for the coming year as new stablecoins are issued on Celo.

## Application Activity Monitor

The Application Activity dashboard enables investors, protocol developers, and community members to monitor the usage of protocols and dapps on the Celo blockchain. For example, users can track the number of Daily Active Users (DAUs) for Haraka on-chain. This provides critical insights into the functionality and engagement within the Celo ecosystem.

Additionally, this tool helps viewers understand the primary use cases of the chain. E.g., here is Solana’s top applications by active addresses in the last 7 days
![|464x513](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcP1jKM1uCvcEtiMW098DQOoxl99eAgLJ-LhxLlirqE9EFzAntKTRysIzia8j0CW56vikXJO1DwjHw8B544PDSInM6KXcA4wfW23RKv8iQqRXRsHCJAFdR0xz7eohDKXgHSWzgrC3FzGEW7hgMqhnrYTg39?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

We see that Raydium is a top DEX for Solana – clicking on Raydium allows us to see KPIs for Raydium like daily active addresses and we see that Raydium has gained almost 200k daily users since its launch.
![|690x320](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf_Yi4TqHszij2iHfBOytSq2Vr5TkmCWr3v2nxS3C36HUGN_2tI9s6nYs9w7QKsuYCSYZOluW-1mlXMAEXYnt4SXywqt0Q56A32e4e32js5hVpi82rv5JZs5bsIdRnJ7UtyYCqW1arphzu0xbqTjlOQHh0?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

Furthermore, Application Activity Monitor breaks down a chain’s use by sector, another critical feature to understand the health of an ecosystem. For example, for Solana, we see that DeFi comprises a health chunk of activity and growing over time:
![|761x269](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcgNttumhptxgbRc6KStUC1E5yGJ47wqQeYSHsOdZSLCl0N0iobZ9VTsn0Q9-55PHj-Iz5U-lNQ5a32CZwdKjCC438ih1OXKxWNozLW45to-zhFcRkH6glFnXmqvFsFK2iwV6LwHGyXTPyXWmcgRD3dphSq?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

Whereas NFT activity has died down significantly since the NFT boom:
![|762x272](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdlxaWYrDkrrvMFIpp5sk_1rMzd8DWxZ54gzOw8lIG9Lzja4rW9H30Jd6hNDndhkZ7RnONgcQPg1aofGDumkHgW1yaOHsy7mhKeqXq-bg74EH573HKlAAbibxYl8VW_gpsk52Iz0bpQ_5zwxzM_rE5a5Lo?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

**This understanding is crucial for any blockchain as it allows the community to align their efforts with the ecosystem's long-term goals. For Celo, being a chain focused on real-world usage, it is essential to see RWAs (Real World Assets) and stablecoins proliferate the main use cases**. Furthermore, this dashboard facilitates benchmarking Celo against other ecosystems.

Investors also highly value the Application Activity Monitor as it provides a comprehensive view of the applications on the chain and their usage metrics. This is a critical component of a token investor’s due diligence process. **Without this data, investors will lack the confidence to invest in a particular token. For example, Franklin Templeton uses the Activity Monitor to evaluate the usage of Base and Friend.tech on Base: https://twitter.com/FTI_DA/status/1788617086261944799.**

# Specifications: Stablecoin Dashboards

We are proposing a suite of new stablecoin products to support Celo in their efforts to drive stablecoin adoption.

### 1) Stablecoin V3

Stablecoin V3 is a complete rebuild of our stablecoin dashboard that makes it much easier for viewers to quickly get insights without having to press a series or buttons. It is laid out like a newspaper where the first page in the homepage that lets users quickly grock the most important stablecoin data. The other section include a usage section that allows viewers to see what applications the stables are being used for and a flows section that track inflows/outflows of stablecoins for every chain and currency we support.

![|486x640](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXczlaHhpFCpRHoK7-qlmM8mYrU_TR0NwnKgG_6rPX3nopj-v8wdGbiYxjvIY9hItsRaarjTkrsPE1LTo7h9I52dnZTBmjCo_U9LHOXruw9laeViuFTnwWGW1DApS2ImrfiBrPPTT-wiie8uuuTkg-PLAD-a?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

This is a new geo dashboard that allows viewers to understand stablecoin activity by geographic location
![|481x436](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTtLXA9Mf9YHpTc_u_LNDzsU98qvJtIN1KfZiy6HXddIJl3No24n4OHMRYItkiDcH4w92QdG4SSPsojRKIzqF83KajacI0uTehilSi7hZeBu1j0yDNitavOnstYyw8a6FVCQjhvPbFTRwMsfqU?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

Finally this is the inflow/outflow dashboard. Stablecoin flows is an important dataset as it’s a leading indicator to interest and price action for an ecosystem

![|474x572](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeLFD3pduolMjAhhL9ofB4O7N_ZuK1DTTGURJlk7detghOkbDweKbsx6tPfV_tKF0iWJI8BZpn45wMVOIRHS3pftzSkbzwoNKm2_sbQvtogOuBjYh-KFggQBvkfQKIEBlRRgAn7532peBS8pIJ40qTpZtxT?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

Artemis will continue to build out new stablecoin dashboards as the industry involves so expect even more views in the future.

### 2) Project Page for every Celo stablecoin (including future stables in the coming year)

We are building bespoke stablecoin pages for stablecoins we support to allow viewers to learn more about specific stablecoins. We envision having a page for every Celo stablecoin on the market to help viewers understand more about Celo’s unique non-USD stables (and more).

![|530x460](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcyVrzWiwiNdsZs7wFnpKAYEzZbVe69peuxCtx06rfrmP51Dl7Ch3gaI67HhX3Yj3sdhbKBY8pdY3iks91m4DxKoP-lbEuIYvZY8kBviuUPxxW5OHMUZA_WiI8HlInDtNKoZCG4Lt4YEt0CmHoTr_EBVwcz?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

### 3) Other

- **Regular Updates**: Keep the stablecoin dashboards updated with new stablecoin additions and the latest data. This includes support for new currencies and ensuring all relevant metrics are accurately represented (such as adding cKES: https://forum.celo.org/t/final-launch-of-a-kenyan-shilling-stablecoin/7964).

- **User-Friendly Enhancements**: Continuously improve the user interface and user experience based on feedback from the community. This ensures the dashboards are easy to navigate and provide the necessary insights at a glance.

- **Comprehensive Support**: Provide ongoing support to ensure that the stablecoin dashboards meet the evolving needs of the Celo Foundation and the broader community. This includes working closely with key stakeholders, like Mento lead Marcus, to ensure the dashboards align with strategic objectives.

# Specifications: Application Activity Monitor

The Application Activity Monitor enables anyone to see which Celo applications are driving usage. This tool is invaluable for investors conducting due diligence and screening new protocols for potential investment. Key features include:

- **Application Project Page**: Similar to the above Stablecoin Project Pages, Application Project Pages are bespoke pages that show off specific applications (e.g. Helium below) that include qualitative and quantitative information about dapps. For Celo, this could be for Valora, Haraka, or Good Dollar. Critically, this allows investors to gain a deeper understanding into what apps are actually being built in an ecosystem and its KPIs, especially if the investor is new to an ecosystem.

![|677x418](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdSCEKN_hlT3WQ94Jlvl2UTK5Gef9WJHQUtzZwbsjbMExw6MDIE1y2GYRL8N1o9hjNYrh5-jDtWMqfJoRbpdSRZRj6Vm3lw6fCW6uWOtk6lD1Cen_05HrC-tDIKNudDWsje-gE5-l_AYxQWB3_r1W-pj_NN?key=Pq9WEWBwyofQOMyZQX6bWw)

- **Sector Analysis**: This feature breaks down Celo’s blockchain usage by sector, allowing users to track over time the percentage of usage dedicated to P2P payments, DeFi, NFTs, and more. For example, similar sector analysis on Ethereum provides insights into the health and diversity of its ecosystem. Investors rely on this analysis to understand the robustness and breadth of a chain’s ecosystem before making investment decisions.

- **Trending Apps**: The Application Activity Monitor also highlights dapps that have seen the most significant increases in DAUs, daily transactions, and gas usage. This helps users identify which applications are gaining popularity and traction within the ecosystem. Trending applications are excellent candidates for Celo’s Bloom initiative (https://bloom.celo.org/), aiding Bloom organizers in identifying and supporting promising protocol teams.

# Why Artemis?

-  **Free and Open Access**: Artemis champions free, open, and transparent crypto data. Our founders' experience in traditional finance, where high-quality financial data was expensive and exclusive, motivated us to change this paradigm. In the crypto space, we envision a world where anyone with internet access can educate themselves and participate in the new economy. ***To support this vision, Artemis commits to keeping our dashboards free forever. We collaborate with the community to fund development, ensuring our data remains accessible to all.***

-  **Close Relationships with RWA and Stablecoin Builders**: Artemis works closely with key leaders in the Real World Assets (RWA) and Stablecoin space, such as Circle, Tether, Castle Island Ventures, & BlueChip.org.  These relationships enable Artemis to stay at the forefront of developments in the industry, ensuring that our data are in the hands of the key opinion leaders of the space.

-  **Most Cited Institutional Data Provider in the Space**: Artemis Citations: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Re7VbBr0Mf6nTtyO0yErE8qLOrtKqYqOjtpFC4ATYQM/edit#slide=id.g2e0f1db53f8_0_267

# Funding Request

Two major updates since last proposal:

 1. We understand that the previous pricing was too high for Celo given Celo's recent price drawdown. Artemis wants to be collaborative long-term partners to the Celo community and so decided to **reduce our pricing for Celo by ~US$100,000**. This is lower than our standard pricing for ecosystems but we are very excited for the future of Celo and want to make a one-off exception to our pricing model to support Celo.
 2. We are **requesting cUSD to address concerns about sell-pressure on CELO** in the last proposal.
 3. To address concerns on vendors not delivering value after funding has been dispersed, we are proposing **Artemis receives half of the fund once the proposal passes and the second half 1 year later if Celo is happy with the work** Artemis has delivered.

Our pricing model reflects the extensive expertise and ongoing support required to ensure these tools are continuously updated, reliable, and user-friendly:  

 - **Stablecoin Dashboard Suite**: US$80k in cUSD
 - **Application Activity Monitor**: US$95k in cUSD 

**Total Funding Request**: US$175k in cUSD

**Multisig Signers**:

Safe Wallet Address: 0xd1a06a4477b9E4633E6E56D8f9EB9ccD39cE36Bc

-  **Anthony Yim (CTO):** 0x9F02cb2C5Ae4CAA945fB581E8136c64eb95e89f2

-  **Jon Ma (CEO):** 0x4ccAe83218d7824160C76964B239F1a89373d251

-  **Jimmy Zheng (COO):** 0x72c131C57a994b24F171F1c208bCB111832Bea76

# Conclusion

Artemis believes that Celo is one of the most underrated crypto ecosystems. Celo’s focus on improving financial access in emerging markets means that its metrics viewed through traditional DeFi lenses don't tell the full story of Celo. **However, Artemis can work closely with the Celo community to tell its authentic story to institutional investors through data in an objective and transparent way so that Celo becomes top of mind for investors around the world again.**

By incorporating the feedback from the community from the first proposal, including a significant price reduction, we hope the Celo community will consider the proposal again and be in favor of a long-term partnership between Artemis and Celo!

## Proposed Changes
### Transactions
Unique Transaction of US$175000 cUSD to Multisign ```0xd1a06a4477b9E4633E6E56D8f9EB9ccD39cE36Bc```
Half (US$87500) when the proposal passes and the second half 1 year after the proposal passes if Celo Community is happy with Artemis' work. Artemis will withdraw half when the proposal passses and withdraw the second half a year later if Celo is happy with the work Artemis delivered. We will work closely with Celo Foundation to determine if Artemis' work has been satisfactory.

Overview
============================
- CGP - 0198
 
## Status
- PROPOSED
 
Proposal Description
============================
# Summary
The Celo Regional Council requests funding for Season 1 operations to serve as a decentralised coordination and growth layer across the Celo ecosystem. Evolving from a loose collective into a structured body, the Council now acts as a strategic layer localising impact, harmonising proposals, and onboarding users and builders through a shared framework.

This proposal consolidates ecosystem funding for all Regional HUBs under a single banner while establishing a governance structure that promotes transparency, alignment, and long-term sustainability.

## Season 1 goals
* Execute a regional governance model with voting representation from four macro-regions (Africa, Europe, LatAm, Asia)
* Empower local nodes to activate ecosystem intents (Grow TXs and TVL)
* Standardise metrics, tooling, and community contribution infrastructure
* Drive ecosystem growth through events, integrations, and protocol onboarding, always aligned with S1 Intents

---
# Motivation
Over the past seven months, the Council has transitioned from experimentation to execution, moving from regional silos to a networked model of cooperation. This evolution surfaced the need for a clear governance structure and a sustainable flywheel to power long-term growth.

Key insights from Season 0:
* Fragmented local efforts created duplicated work and coordination gaps
* High-context contributors need lightweight, supportive governance—not bureaucratic overhead
* Grassroots wins *(e.g. wallet downloads, protocol pilots, txs growth)* often lacked visibility or support at the global level

The Regional Council directly addresses these challenges by:
* Translating global strategy *(e.g. Vision 2030, Season Intents)* into regional tactics
* Supporting local nodes to engage real communities, not just run paid activations
* Embedding promising builders within high-context regions for long-term impact

---
# Specification
At the end of Season 1 we expect to formalize the Regional Hub + Local Node structure. Each macro-region (Africa, Europe, LatAm, Asia) will have a representative with voting rights, ensuring all regions contribute to ecosystem-wide decisions. Local nodes execute region-specific programs, report impact, and co-develop tooling and strategy.

#### Future Governance Structure
* 4 Voting Members *(1 per macro-region)*
* Open Participation from all regional nodes
* Internal Governance Models per region *(to ensure local voice, shared coordination, transparent reporting)*

# Current Status
For insights into Season 1’s journey, lessons, and foundational work, as well as broader context and strategic basis, refer to the [Celo Regional Council — H1 2025 Report.](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-regional-council-h1-2025-report)

Regarding S1, after carefully reviewing all proposals, we added comments and assessed each using the “ChatGPT test” provided by Celo Growth team alongside our own judgment to evaluate alignment with the Intent for Season 1.

Only the proposals that met these criteria have moved forward to the voting phase.

The result is a total approved budget of $486,650 (452,450 cUSD + 114,000 CELO in CELO at 0,3 US/Celo rate).

## Please note:
* **Special thanks to Celo Philippines** for their cooperation during the voting process. Koh Celo was initially not approved but was eventually included with a smaller budget and improved alignment with the Season 1 intents.
* Celo Mexico presented a special case. The Council identified ongoing internal conflicts and instances of unprofessional conduct, which prevented us from approving the proposal in its original form. These issues must be resolved before any future funding discussions. Their budget has been reduced to 15,000 cUSD, which will be managed by the LatAm Regional Hub and disbursed based on clearly defined milestones.
* Celo Turkey’s proposal was approved, but with a reduced budget to align with the process we started seven months ago with India and Arabia, establishing a limited initial budget for new regional openings.

This has been a challenging yet constructive process. We’ve all worked hard to bring greater transparency, alignment, and efficiency to this phase.

In the accompanying [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-KnDtIAhMPq-h0T8wdVzgegAV3OPEDMz5zAkN_jl8Gk/edit?gid=736371407#gid=736371407), you will find:

1. Season-to-season budget comparisons
2. Draft 1: including all submitted proposals
3. Final Draft: only the approved and voted proposals
4. Budget comparison for Intent 1, including CPG, Stabila, Prezenti, and the Regional Council

We believe this proposal reflects the community’s strong intention to work closely with the Celo Foundation’s goals, strengthen the ecosystem, and bring more professionalism and improved methodologies. Our current proposal is solid and will be publicly defended in the upcoming days.

Thank you again for your trust and support. We believe this final agreement shows a strong commitment to the Intent of Season 1 while maintaining a lean structure focused on key growth and community activities such as Celo Gather in Africa and DevConnect 2025 in LatAm.

As illustrated in the chart above, the Regional Council has succeeded in aligning proposals across the ecosystem while reducing or stabilising budgets in nearly all regions. Most proposals experienced budget cuts ranging from 5% to 30%.

Despite these reductions, the Council prioritised retaining key activities and ensuring continuity in high-impact regions, especially those with demonstrated alignment with Season 1 Intents.

This outcome reflects not only a collective commitment to lean and accountable spending, but also an improved shared understanding of how to frame regional work within a global strategy. The Council has shown its ability to make difficult decisions, balance diverse priorities, and uphold the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

We believe this is a clear sign of governance maturity and a solid foundation for continued decentralisation.

Verification
============================
A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command (on-chain ID determined after submission):
$ celocli governance:show --proposalID 245 --node https://forno.celo.org


Risks
============================
- This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.
- This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

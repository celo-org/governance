## Overview

This proposal outlines the final steps for the launch of the $PUSO stablecoin, proposed by Celo Philippines DAO, on the Mento platform.

The proposal includes transactions that when executed will do the following:

## Risks

There are couple of risks factors to take into account when launching new stablecoin like $PUSO:

- Data providers report the price that is different from the actual PHP/USD exchange rate.

In conjunction with the Mento team the contract changes have been thoroughly tested, in addition to putting tight limits and circuit breakers during the initial launch phase to protect the Mento Reserve and $PUSO holders.

## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 4. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/celo-core-contracts-v5.post-audit). 
OpenZeppelin and Certora have both completed audits of release 4, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the release notes for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)
- `Accounts`: `1.1.1.1` => `1.1.2.0`
- `Election`: `1.1.1.0` => `1.1.2.0`
- `Governance`: `1.2.0.2` => `1.2.1.0`
- `GoldToken`: `1.1.1.0` => `1.1.1.1`
- `Reserve`: `1.1.2.0` => `1.1.2.1`


## Verification

Fetch onchain proposal:
```
celocli governance:show --proposalID 29 --jsonTransactions release-4-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

Verify proposal points to deployment which matches audited release:
```
cd monorepo/packages/protocol
yarn verify-release -p release-4-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v4 -n mainnet -f
```

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. This proposal touches contracts which impact Celo's Proof-of-Stake and consensus, the stability and identity protocol and Governance itself. 
While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

**Authors:** [Daniel Kimotho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-kimotho-2a43324a/) , [Umar Sebyala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umarsebyalabukenya/) , [Chimezie Chuta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chimeziechuta/) , [Cynthia Kamau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthiakamau/)

**Budget Request:** $248,300 cUSD

**Proposal Type:** CPG Funding Request | Regional DAO

We’re excited to share our Final proposal for Celo Africa H1 2024 in line with the [Celo Public Goods Funding proposal](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-governance-guidelines-and-public-goods-funding-strategy-h1-2024/7200), with all the incorporated feedback and improvements from the [Draft proposal](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-africa-h1-2024-regional-dao-draft/7382/25)

**Summary**

The proposal aims to allocate funds to the Celo Africa DAO from February 1st to June 30th, 2024, amounting to $248,300 cUSD. The goal is to accelerate the adoption of Celo throughout the African continent, including plans for expansion into Ghana and South Africa. The proposal outlines three primary focus areas: the Incubator program, attracting Web 3 talent to develop on Celo, and enhancing market awareness and brand positioning. By strategically allocating funds to these specific focus areas, the proposal endeavors to fortify and propel the Celo ecosystem within the African region during the specified time period.

**Motivation**

Following the success of [Celo Africa DAO’s trial season 0 1](https://forum.celo.org/t/report-celo-africa-dao-year-end-report/7072), we recognize the significant value in extending its presence into 2024. This aims to leverage the established networks from season 0 and maintain a robust foothold in the African market.

**Introduction**

Celo Africa DAO has actively worked over the past six months to foster the adoption of Celo in Africa. During this time, we’ve successfully organized workshops and engaged with developers, inspiring a wave of innovation. Our initial focus has been on enhancing the capabilities of developers and founders.

As we move forward, our next significant step involves a more profound commitment to supporting talented community members, including developers, researchers, designers, and enthusiasts, in bringing their ideas to life to address some of Africa’s most pressing challenges. While our efforts to build and expand the ecosystem and raise brand awareness will continue, we are now taking a significant stride forward by introducing an incubator program and expanding to Ghana and South Africa. This marks the essence of Proposal 2.0, where we delve deeper into the details of our vision.

The DAO will run an incubator program focused on Web3 founders building on Celo. Successful founders from each cohort will be presented to Celo Camp for acceleration and investment. The Incubator Program for African Innovators is designed to support early-stage Web3 projects in Africa by providing vital resources(technical support), mentorship, and essential infrastructure. Our program empowers entrepreneurs to navigate the complex Web3 landscape and aims to stimulate user growth on minipay and transaction growth on Celo in Africa.

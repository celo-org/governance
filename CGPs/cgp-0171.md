## Overview
Following a recent [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposing-celo-l2s-security-council/10578) from cLabs, the community is requested to weigh in and vote on Celo's new L2’s Security Council.
 
A "Yes" vote will denote agreeing to implement "L2’s Security Council" as described in this [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposing-celo-l2s-security-council/10578). A "No" vote will denote not agreeing to the "L2’s Security Council". An "Abstain" vote will denote neither agreeing to nor disagreeing with either option, but instead will help to achieve the minimum needed level of quorum needed to pass a resolution.
 
## Proposed Changes
 
There are no onchain changes at this point. After the L2 transition, the L2’s Security Council will be the owner of the [Proxy Admin](https://github.com/celo-org/optimism/blob/pahor/genesisGeneration/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol) in the L1.
 
## Verification
 
You can verify the proposal with the following cli command:

`$ celocli governance:view --proposalID 218 -n https://forno.celo.org`

The proposal should show no transactions.
 
## Risks
 
As there are no on-chain actions performed at the time of executing this proposal, no risks arise in the short term.

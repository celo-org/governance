## Proposal Description
We are asking for 200,000 CELO to deploy our whole infrastructure on Celo’s upcoming L2 and unlock features (listed below) for builders and users. We will work closely with the Celo Foundation to deploy this infrastructure and support builder onboarding.

### Project Goals and Aspirations
The Biconomy SDK simplifies blockchain development for dApp developers, providing an array of features that offer a seamless Web2-like experience to end-users. Once enabled within the chain, developers can build a wide range of use cases, from token transfers to smart contract interactions. The SDK is secure and reliable, ensuring dApps are safe from attacks and hacks. It is an essential tool for developers looking to build superior dApps on the blockchain.

**1. Custom Signature Schemes & Biometric Passkeys** - Biometric logins, BLS signature aggregation, and quantum-resistant digital signatures such as Schnorr can be supported with Biconomy. Users can enjoy a more secure and robust digital signature scheme that is simpler and less susceptible to attack vectors.

**2. Gas-less transactions** - Improve user onboarding and engagement with a gasless flow. With Biconomy, users can enjoy a gasless flow, making transaction execution faster and more straightforward.

**3. Transactions and gas payments in non-native tokens** - Allow users to pay for transactions and gas any ERC20 token (200+ tokens across 25+ chains and counting). This feature makes it easier for users to have a seamless transaction experience without having to go through the hassle of exchanging their tokens into native tokens.

**4. Transaction Batching** - Group common transactions to offer gas-light execution and one-click experiences. With Biconomy, common transactions can be batched to offer a gas-light execution that saves users gas fees, thereby making the transaction process more efficient.

**5. MultiChain Signatures** - This features allows for dispatching multiple userOps to different EVM chains and execute the same transactions on all chains in parallel, with a single user signature.

**6. Session Keys** - You can create a login session for your user, within which the user can use the dApp without repeatedly signing in. This feature makes it more convenient for users to use dApps without having to sign in repeatedly.

**7. Automations** - Users can set up recurring payments, Dollar Cost Averaging, or even CEX-like features such as automating purchase/sell based on on-chain triggers like price.

**8. Limits, Allowlists, and Access Control** - You can apply custom transaction execution limits and whitelist/blacklist addresses at the contract level. With Biconomy, users can enjoy more flexibility and control over their transactions, allowing them to customize their transaction execution limits and whitelist or blacklist addresses at the contract level.

## Budget and Milestones
We will approach chain support with an on-chain and an off-chain tech stack. These are mutually exclusive and can be used separately or together to provide the best experience for developers. Our stack is ERC4337 compliant, it’s compatible with all ERC4337 compliant providers’ infra and Smart Accounts and we do not have any vendor lock-in for builders.

### Milestones
Here’s the estimated timeline for the integration, you can find below the detailed explanation of each item.

**1. Independent On-chain Stack:**
The on-chain stack comprises all critical contracts necessary for EIP 4337. Once deployed, any developer or project can utilize these contracts to offer services related to 4337. The EntryPoint acts as a universal entry point for all ERC-4337-compliant smart contract wallets. Module extends the functionality of these smart accounts, and Paymasters sponsor transactions for users, enabling various use cases.

**a. EntryPoint Contract (Core Singleton Contract)**

The EntryPoint contract is a pivotal global singleton contract that acts as the universal entry point for all ERC-4337-compliant smart contract wallets. This essential component standardizes interactions between wallets and the Ethereum network and streamlines and secures transaction handling. By systematically managing multiple user operations through the EntryPoint contract’s handleOps() function, which features verification and execution loops, each operation is executed with utmost security and efficiency.

Timelines for deployment and integration: Week 2-5
Costing for deployment and future maintenance: None

**b. Smart Contracts of Module & Extensions**

Smart Contract Wallet Modules under the EIP-4337 standard are pivotal in bolstering the functionality and scalability of the blockchain ecosystem. These modules are instrumental in handling the UserOperation signatures, granting users an enhanced level of control and security over their transactions. Specifically, they provide a modular approach to wallet design, enabling customization based on user preferences. This adaptability ensures that the wallet can evolve alongside the ever-changing dynamics of the blockchain industry, further promoting seamless user interaction and safeguarding assets. You can check out our modules here.

Timelines for deployment and integration: Week 2-5
KPI : Total transactions processed via the Smart Contract Wallet Module, signifying the module’s efficiency in streamlining the transaction process as per EIP-4337.

**c. Paymaster Smart Contracts**

Paymasters play a pivotal role in sponsoring transactions for users, opening the door to various use cases, such as fee subsidies, ERC-20 token payments, off-chain payment methods, and on-chain credit services. By fostering a more inclusive ecosystem and enabling frictionless transactions for users, Paymasters drive innovation and adoption across the platform.

Timelines for deployment and integration: Week 2-5
KPI: Number of sponsored transactions processed by Paymaster contracts

**d. Smart Contract Wallet Standard & Factory**

The Smart Contract Wallet Standard establishes a comprehensive, unified framework for smart contract wallets, ensuring seamless interoperability and smooth integration within the broader ecosystem. Paired with the Wallet Factory, a contract that streamlines wallet creation by deploying standardized wallet instances, developers benefit from cost-efficient and simplified wallet deployment, significantly lowering barriers to entry.

Timelines for deployment and integration: Week 2-5
KPI: Number of wallets created using the factory.

**2. Independent Off-chain Stack**
We are developing an off-chain stack that includes bundlers and off-chain memepool creation. This will be offered as a service, so that other dapps can use this bundler and the entire off-chain stack even if they make their own Smart Wallets or Paymaster contracts.

The off-chain stack provides bundlers to optimize transaction processing and reduce network congestion, alternative mempool and node connectivity for efficient off-chain transaction processing, and developer tools such as a dashboard and documentation to facilitate integration.

**a. Bundler API (with full backend)**

Bundlers are essential off-chain nodes designed to optimize the Ethereum network. They constantly monitor the UserOperation mempool, intelligently grouping multiple UserOperations together. This bundling process enhances transaction processing efficiency, prioritizes fee distribution, and significantly reduces network congestion, ultimately leading to a smoother, more reliable ecosystem.

Timelines for deployment and integration: Week 4-7
KPI: Number of active bundlers and UserOperations processed by them at scale in a given timeframe

**b. Aggregated Paymaster API (with full backend)**

This API streamlines transactions, facilitating easy transitions between Sponsorship and ERC20 modes. Through our solution, users can opt for gasless transactions or utilize an array of supported ERC20 tokens for gas payments, underscoring the adaptability and user-centric design of the system. You can check out list of supported tokens here.

Timelines for deployment and integration: Week 4-7

KPI: Number of sponsored transactions processed by Paymaster API and Number of tokens supported for ERC20 gas by Paymaster API

**c. Developer Tools: Comprehensive Dashboard, SDK, Documentation, and Code Samples**

This component is focused on providing an all-in-one solution for developers by creating extensive documentation, practical code samples, and a feature-rich developer dashboard. The dashboard offers a unified view of user operations, paymasters, and bundlers, enabling developers to manage and monitor all aspects of their EIP-4337 integration seamlessly. By empowering developers with a single, intuitive interface and invaluable resources, we aim to drive innovation and adoption of the EIP-4337 infrastructure across the ecosystem.

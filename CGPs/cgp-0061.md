## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 8. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v8.pre-audit).
Hacken.io has completed an audit of release 8, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v8.pre-audit) for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

- [ ] TODO (@m-chrzan or @alecps): Set correct versions below.

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)

- `FederatedAttestations`: `1.1.3.0` => `1.1.4.0` (**illustrative versions for example**)
- `Escrow`: `1.1.1.2` => `1.1.2.0` (**illustrative versions for example**)

## Verification

- [ ] TODO (@m-chrzan or @alecps): Update commands with correct `.json` file names (**illustrative `.json` files below for example**)

Fetch onchain proposal: 

```bash
celocli governance:show --proposalID <TBD> --jsonTransactions release-7-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

Verify proposal points to deployment which matches audited release:

```bash
cd monorepo/packages/protocol
yarn verify-release -p release-7-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v7 -n mainnet -f
```

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

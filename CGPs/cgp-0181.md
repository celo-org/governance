## Overview

The Score Management Committee was established as part of the original Great
Celo Halvening Parameters proposal to manage score tracing of validators
community RPCs. The initial formation and funding details were completed prior
to the hard fork. The work has already commenced with the extended committee,
and this proposal aims to formalize these changes and ensure adequate funding
for all members.

This proposal seeks to formalize the expansion of the Score Management Committee
by adding two new members (@swiftstaking, @kamikazechaser) and securing
additional funding for their compensation. The committee began operating in its
extended form following the hard fork, and this proposal is designed to
retroactively align governance and funding with the committee’s current
structure and operations.

## Proposal Description

The Score Management Committee has been operating in an expanded capacity since
the hard fork, with two additional members contributing to its responsibilities.
This proposal seeks to:

- Retroactively formalize the inclusion of these two new members in the
  committee
- Update records to reflect the current composition
- Allocate additional funding to compensate the new members fairly for their
  contributions

This proposal will allocate additional funds to the existing multisig wallet to
retroactively compensate the new committee members, maintaining parity with
current member compensation.

## Proposed Changes

1. Transaction 1: Funding The Score Management Committee for New Committee
   Members

- Description: Transfer additional funds (24K cUSD) to the existing Score
  Management Committee multisig wallet to fund for retroactive compensation of
  new committee members
- Destination: 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a (cUSD contract)
- Data: approve(address spender = 0x68ce71d4CECA3003701ca6844D9a345925407455,
  uint256 value = 24000000000000000000000 (24K cUSD))
- Value: 0

2. Transaction 2: Update Safe Multisig Wallet (Action for current The Score
   Management Committee)

- Description: Extend the safe multisig wallet to include new committee members’
  addresses.
- Destination: Existing multisig wallet for Score Management Committee
  0x68ce71d4CECA3003701ca6844D9a345925407455.
- Data: Add the following addresses to the multisig wallet: @swiftstaking:
  0x8e52a8822dFBb2eA6cEdb84032A8acce7Fc05838 @kamikazechaser:
  0x0330F6bE6aCE2D975b4aC7Be109C46015C508BB1. To be executed by existing signers
  of the multisig.
- Value: 0 CELO (no direct value transfer for this action).

## Rationale

The initial formation of the committee occurred prior to the hard fork,
resulting in a structure that did not account for expanded post-fork
responsibilities. The extended committee began working immediately after the
hard fork, ensuring continuity in ecosystem management. This proposal ensures
governance alignment with operational realities while compensating all
contributors fairly.

## Verification

Voters can verify this proposal by:

1. Reviewing the original Great Celo Halvening Parameters proposal where the
   Score Management Committee was established: Set The Great Celo Halvening
   Parameters
2. Confirming that work has already commenced with an extended committee
   structure
3. Verifying that proposed compensation aligns with existing member rates

## Risks

1. Governance Misalignment: Retroactive formalization addresses any
   discrepancies between governance records and current operations.
2. Budget Impact: Additional funding is proportional to established compensation
   rates and ensures fiscal responsibility.

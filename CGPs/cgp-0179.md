Overview
============================
- CGP-0179

On behalf of Stabila Foundation, this proposal corrects the spending allowance for the Stabila Multi-sig (0x9C257bDC314dc516e673728D70F45444F6e22412) by restoring the remaining **2,136,556.64 CELO** from the original **5M CELO** allocation approved by the Celo Community Fund in May 2024 via [CGP 132](https://forum.celo.org/t/restore-remaining-celo-spend-allowance-to-stabila-multi-sig/10858).

Proposal Description
============================
### Summary
On behalf of Stabila Foundation, this proposal corrects the spending allowance for the Stabila Multi-sig (0x9C257bDC314dc516e673728D70F45444F6e22412) by restoring the remaining **2,136,556.64 CELO** from the original **5M CELO** allocation approved by the Celo Community Fund in May 2024 via [CGP 132](https://forum.celo.org/t/restore-remaining-celo-spend-allowance-to-stabila-multi-sig/10858).

To date, **2,863,443.36 CELO** have been withdrawn under that original authorization. However, the subsequent proposal, [CGP 162](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-162), which approved an **additional 2M CELO + 1M cUSD** for Aave liquidity support, unintentionally **overwrote** the previous CELO allowance instead of layering on top of the unwithdrawn balance.

**Reinstating the unwithdrawn 2,136,556.64 CELO** brings the allowance back in line with the original governance intent.

### Motivation
The **5M CELO** approved in [CGP 132](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-132) funded the launch of the Stabila Foundation and its mission of accelerating stablecoin adoption across Celo. As of February 2025, only **2,863,443.36 CELO** had been withdrawn under that authorization.

On **February 27, 2025**, the community passed [CGP 162](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-162), which approved an additional **2M CELO + 1M cUSD** to support Aave’s deployment on Celo. However, the on-chain implementation of CGP 162 used approve() rather than increaseAllowance(), thereby resetting the CELO allowance for the Stabila Multi-sig to 2M CELO. This unintentionally removed the remaining ~2.14M CELO balance from CGP 132.

Correcting this allowance is essential to ensure alignment with governance intent and to enable Stabila to continue executing its mandate, including the On-Chain FX campaign and the Uniswap DAO co-incentive commitments.

### Specification
This proposal restores the remaining **2,136,556.64 CELO** from the original **5M CELO** allocation approved under CGP 132 (Stabila Inception), which was unintentionally overwritten by [CGP 162](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-162) (Aave Liquidity & Incentive Support).

Withdrawal history confirms that **2,863,443.36 CELO** was withdrawn from the Community Fund before CGP 162 implementation, leaving **2,136,556.64 CELO unwithdrawn** from the original authorization. Detailed transaction records can be found in the [Filtered Celoscan View](https://celoscan.io/advanced-filter?fadd=0xD533Ca259b330c7A88f74E000a3FaEa2d63B7972&tadd=0x9C257bDC314dc516e673728D70F45444F6e22412%2c0x9208C6bb501302CB0cCF8f07Cd391828bcc07731&txntype=2&qt=1&tkn=celo%2c0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438&ps=50).

Currently, [CeloScan’s GoldToken Read Proxy Contract](https://celoscan.io/token/0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438#readProxyContract) shows **605,261.16 CELO** remains available for withdrawal by the Stabila multisig. This reflects the 2M CELO approved under CGP 162, minus the 1,394,738.84 CELO already withdrawn after its implementation.

- [GoldToken ReadContract](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1MGsJhA1g.png)

The [GitHub implementation of CGP 162](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0162.md?plain=1) confirms that the following approve() function was called:

```
{
"contract": "GoldToken",
"address": "0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438",
"function": "approve",
"args": [
"0x9C257bDC314dc516e673728D70F45444F6e22412",
"2000000000000000000000000"
],
"value": "0"
}
```

To correct this and restore the 2,136,556.64 CELO from CGP 132, this proposal will execute the following increaseAllowance() call:

```
{
"contract": "GoldToken",
"address": "0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438",
"function": "increaseAllowance",
"args": [
"0x9C257bDC314dc516e673728D70F45444F6e22412",
"2136556640000000000000000"
],
"value": "0"
}
```

This will fully reinstate the original 5M CELO authorization from CGP 132, bringing the Stabila multisig’s allowance back in line with community-approved intent.

Risks
============================
This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters, so it represents minimal risk to the network. This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

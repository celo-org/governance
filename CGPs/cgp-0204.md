Proposal Description
============================
# Summary
The Celo Regional Council requests funding for Season 1 operations to serve as a decentralized coordination and growth layer for the ecosystem.

This proposal consolidates ecosystem funding for all Regional Hubs under a single, transparent governance framework. Instead of fragmented proposals and duplicated work, the Council acts as a strategic layer to localize Season 1 Intents, harmonize metrics, and scale adoption globally through a network of regional hubs.

By pooling resources, the Council ensures alignment with Vision 2030 and Season 1 priorities, reduces operational overhead, and creates a sustainable model for ecosystem growth.

## Season 1 Goals
* **Execute a regional governance model** with voting representation from four macro-regions: Africa, Europe, LatAm, Asia.
* **Empower local nodes** to activate ecosystem intents *(Grow TXs and TVL).*
* **Standardize metrics, reporting, and community contribution tooling** for consistency across regions.
* **Deliver measurable growth** through high-impact events, integrations, and protocol onboarding aligned with Season 1 Intents.

---
# Motivation
Over the past seven months, the Regional Council evolved from an experimental initiative to a structured coordination model. This process highlighted critical needs:

**Key insights from Season 0:**
* Fragmented local efforts created duplicated work and coordination gaps
* High-context contributors need lightweight, supportive governance—not bureaucratic overhead
* Grassroots wins *(e.g. wallet downloads, protocol pilots, txs growth)* often lacked visibility or support at the global level

**The Regional Council directly addresses these challenges by:**
* Translating global strategy *(e.g. Vision 2030, Season Intents)* into regional tactics
* Supporting local nodes to engage real communities, not just run paid activations
* Embedding promising builders within high-context regions for long-term impact

---
# Specification
At the end of Season 1, the Regional Council will have formalized a governance structure that balances decentralization and efficiency:
* **4 voting members** *(one per macro-region)*
* **Open participation** for all regional nodes
* **Internal governance models per region** to ensure local representation and transparent reporting

This structure enhances global alignment while respecting regional autonomy, enabling hubs to deliver measurable contributions to Season 1 Intents.

## Decentralized by Design: Global Network, Local Impact
Celo’s regional hubs are a decentralized growth engine: **global alignment, local execution**. As Celo transitioned as an Ethereum L2, it turns Season 1 Intents into measurable onchain results by partnering with trusted operators on the ground—meeting users where they already are *(stablecoins, mobile, remittances)*, and channeling that demand into **TX growth, TVL, and integrations** across diverse markets. This structure isn’t just coordination—it’s compounding advantage: shared playbooks and metrics, faster feedback loops, milestone-based funding via regional multisigs, and credibility with local stakeholders like builders, universities, merchants, and regulators.

### Africa
Africa has been the leading region for Celo adoption, especially driven by **MiniPay**, in a market that processed over **$125 million in on-chain value in 2023–24**. **Celo Africa DAO** is a benchmark regional hub, active in countries like **Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and South Africa**. It has delivered significant impact by fostering thousands of developers, onboarding merchants, and running community programs that drove real-world use cases. For this season, their proposal focuses on expanding developer funnels, deepening stablecoin adoption through ramps and community pilots, and enhancing on-chain retention strategies across key African markets.

**Budget requested to activate the Celo ecosystem in Africa: 102,000 cUSD**

### Europe
Europe hosts some of the world’s most advanced blockchain developer ecosystems, contributing to **over $200B in crypto adoption across the region** (Chainalysis). **Celo Europe DAO** has been activating local builders and projects, starting with Vocdoni, which has over 400,000 on-chain transactions, and collaborating with **UNDP** on events, governance, and on-chain deployment initiatives. For this season, their proposal focuses on deploying 10+ MCP-compatible mini apps, onboarding 20+ builders, and publicly tracking 50,000+ cumulative transactions through KarmaGAP and GitHub dashboards.

**Budget requested to activate the Celo ecosystem in Europe: 80,000 cUSD +34,000 Celo**

### Latin America
**Latin America** is one of the fastest-growing regions for Web3 adoption, with high mobile penetration, economic volatility, and over 500 million people creating ideal conditions for Celo and decentralized technologies to thrive. The region is coordinated through a **LATAM Coalition** formed by **CeLatam, Celo Colombia, and Celo Mexico**, covering mainly Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, with proven track records in developer onboarding, stablecoin adoption, merchant integration, and community activation. For this season, the coalition aims to expand on-chain impact through workshops, developer pipelines, and real-world usage of Celo assets, targeting over 100,000 transactions, 190 developers onboarded, 65 smart contracts deployed, 35 dApps launched, and much more, with all activities tracked transparently via KarmaGAP.

**Budget requested to activate the Celo ecosystem in LatAm: $117.000 cUSD + 20.000 Celo**

### Asia *(MENA/APAC)*
Asia is a critical region for Web3 growth, accounting for **over $600B in on-chain value in 2023** (Chainalysis) and hosting some of the largest developer ecosystems fueling L2 adoption. For Season 1, fragmented country-level efforts (Celo India, Celo Arabia, KohCelo, Celo Turkey, Celo PH) are consolidated into a unified MENA/APAC Hub led by Rise In. Leveraging its proven infrastructure across emerging markets (Turkey, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, UAE), Rise In will activate developers through hackathons, roadshows, and workshops, while retaining talent via mentorship and BD support. The goal is to onboard **650+ developers**, generate **250+ projects**, and funnel **30+ startups** into Celo’s global builder programs by the end of 2025.

**Budget requested to activate the Celo ecosystem in Asia: 83,000 $cUSD + 34,000 $Celo**

# Current Status
The Council completed Season 0 (first semester of 2025) with strong progress in alignment, coordination, and ecosystem engagement, laying the foundation for a more structured and impactful Season 1. This season builds on that work with a clearer governance framework, reinforcing measurable targets, and lean resource allocation to maximize efficiency and results.

* *For insights into Season 0’s journey, lessons, and foundational work, as well as broader context and strategic basis, refer to the [Celo Regional Council — H1 2025 Report.](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-regional-council-h1-2025-report)*

Across Season 1, the Council has consolidated regional proposals under one streamlined structure, ensuring alignment with the Season 1 Intents: **growing daily transactions, increasing TVL on Celo**, and supporting sustainable ecosystem expansion. All approved proposals meet these criteria, with budgets calibrated to deliver measurable outcomes while maintaining transparency and accountability.

The total approved budget for Season 1 is **$433,400 (392,000 cUSD + 138,000 Celo at 0.3 US/Celo rate)**. All activities and results will be reported accordingly and publicly tracked through KarmaGAP, GitHub, and dashboards, reinforcing the Council’s commitment to transparent reporting and governance maturity.

This proposal reflects the community’s strong intention to work closely with the Celo Foundation’s goals, strengthen the ecosystem, and implement professional, replicable methodologies. By focusing on high-impact initiatives—such as **Celo Gather during DevConnect 2025 in Argentina** —the Council ensures that resources are directed toward initiatives that generate relevant community growth, and tangible on-chain activity and developer adoption worldwide.

Additionally, in the accompanying [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qUstpQqiQn7UnGZkZBS_sGFcKJMeHObZg1GGJt88uEc), you will find:
1. Season-to-season budget comparisons
2. Draft 1: including all submitted proposals
3. Final Draft: only the approved and voted proposals
4. Budget comparison for Intent 1, including **CPG**, **Stabila**, **Prezenti**, and the **Regional Council**

The Regional Council has succeeded in aligning proposals across the ecosystem while **reducing or stabilising budgets in nearly all regions**.

The Council prioritised **retaining key activities** and ensuring **continuity in high-impact regions**, especially those with demonstrated alignment with Season 1 Intents.

This outcome reflects not only a collective commitment to **lean and accountable spending**, but also an improved shared understanding of **how to frame regional work within a global strategy**. The Council has shown its ability to **make difficult decisions**, balance diverse priorities, and uphold the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

We believe this is a clear sign of governance maturity and a solid foundation for continued decentralisation.

# Why This Matters
The Regional Council is not just funding operations—it is building a scalable, transparent governance model that empowers local communities, amplifies adoption, and creates shared accountability across the ecosystem.

Season 1 is the first step toward a **self-sustaining, decentralized structure that aligns global vision with local execution**, ensuring Celo continues to grow in diverse, high-potential markets worldwide.

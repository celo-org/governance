## Overview

CGP - Celo Governance Proposal

> Hi all, this is a placeholder proposal for increasing the Block Gas Limit to 32M. We will follow this up with another proposal closer to the Sept 8th deadline so we give validators and node operators enough time to upgrade to the specs as noted below in form:

This proposal sets the block gas limit parameter of the Celo blockchain from `20M` to `32M`. The change is motivated by the improvement on block processing throughput with the latest celo-blockchain releases.

For confirming the safety and stability of a block gas limit of `32M`, cLabs Blockchain Team have run load and stability testing during the last weeks.

The change will increase the transaction throughput by way of the increasing the block space by 60%.

## Proposed Change

Increase the block gas limit parameter:

    - Destination: Call `setBlockGasLimit` on the `BlockchainParameters` smart contract owned by `Governance`
    - Data: 32 000 000 (32 Million)
    - Value: 0 (NA)

## Testing

Please check testing of 50M block gas limit in [cgp-0053](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0053.md).

## Verification

* Confirm the proposal: celocli governance:view --proposalID 57
* After execution confirm that the `blockGasLimit` of the `BlockchainParameters` contract changed from 20000000 to 32000000: https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x6E10a8864C65434A721d82e424d727326F9d5Bfa/read-proxy

## Risks

- While metrics in the testing environment indicated that consensus and block production remain within expected bounds, generally speaking, increases in block space mean higher computational needs which could impact consensus and block production under adversarial conditions that were not tested.
- Increasing the block space could lead to a quicker growth of chain state, which in the long run makes running full nodes more resource-intensive and could affect decentralization adversely.

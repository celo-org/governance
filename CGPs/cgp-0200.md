# Proposal Description

This proposal requests $1.5M in funding from the Celo community treasury to support essential ecosystem work stewarded by the Celo Foundation during Season 1 (July–December 2025). These include, but are not limited to, developer growth and programs, industry and community events (technical and non-technical), strategic partnerships, marketing and PR, as well as critical operational support aimed at driving continued awareness for and adoption of Celo. This request is by no means intended to cover all of the Foundation’s operating costs, but rather, to ensure that this scope, for which the community already knows and benefits from, can continue without interruption.

The strategic objectives of these programs are directly aligned with Celo Governance’s Season 1 Intents:

1. Grow daily transactions on Celo
2. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)

# Risks

- This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.
- This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

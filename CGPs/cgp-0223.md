Proposal Description
============================
# 1. Summary
This proposal requests funding for the continuation and operation of the Celo Governance Guild during the 2026 governance year. The Governance Guild (formerly CGP Editors) serves as a neutral governance operations layer, supporting proposal lifecycle coordination, governance calls, documentation, and proposer assistance across Celo Governance.

If approved, this funding will ensure continuity, accountability, and operational stability for governance processes while aligning with Celo’s broader decentralization strategy and the evolution of the Celo governance framework.

## Brief History
Since Celo mainnet genesis and the deployment of the original core contracts, Celo Governance has operated as a community-governed system. While on-chain voting is performed by diverse stakeholders, governance effectiveness relies on a neutral administrative layer that coordinates communication, documentation, and process execution.

Historically, this work was performed by volunteers, with early guidance from Foundation contributors. Over time, and by design, Foundation involvement has been reduced to promote decentralization.

More recently, governance-related work under the Celo Governance Guild demonstrated that critical protocol governance work requires compensation to remain sustainable, accountable, and resilient.

# 2. Motivation
### Governance as Critical Infrastructure
As Celo governance has matured, proposal volume, complexity, and coordination requirements have increased. Governance operations can no longer rely on informal or volunteer-only structures without risking delays, burnout, or process inconsistency.

Funding the Governance Guild ensures:
* Continuity of governance operations
* Preservation of institutional memory
* Consistent proposal quality and process integrity
* Reduced reliance on Foundation bandwidth

### Responsibility, Accountability, and Compensation
Compensation has materially improved accountability and diligence. Formalizing governance operations allows contributors to approach proposals with rigor, consistency, and neutrality benefiting proposers, voters, and the broader ecosystem.

### Independence and Separation of Powers
Celo Governance Guardians act as neutral stewards and advisors, not beneficiaries of the initiatives they oversee. To avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest, governance operations should not be embedded as a line item within the same operational budgets they supervise.

This proposal advances a parallel-but-collaborative model, where governance operations are independently funded while maintaining close coordination with governance stakeholders. This approach future proofs governance against role overlap and cultural drift as contributors rotate over time.

# 3. Specification
The Governance Guild will operate as a neutral governance operations body, explicitly not a political or decision-making entity.

Core responsibilities include:
#### 1. Governance Call Operations
* Schedule planning and governance calls (Google Meet + Lemonade)
* Publish forum posts and GitHub issues for agendas
* Maintain governance calendars and deadlines
* Host and moderate governance calls
* Record, document, and publish call notes

#### 2. Proposal Lifecycle Support
* Track governance proposals on the forum and GitHub
* Provide early feedback and process guidance to proposers
* Ensure proposals follow CGP templates and requirements
* Support on-chain proposal submissions when needed

#### 3. Documentation & Reporting
* Maintain the Celo Governance GitHub repository
* Publish governance summaries and updates
* Draft the weekly Governance section of the Celo Signal Newsletter
* Track governance process improvements and share recommendations

#### 4. Community Enablement
* Lower barriers for new proposers
* Direct contributors to relevant governance documentation
* Improve transparency and voter awareness

# 4. Metrics and KPIs
The Governance Guild’s performance in 2026 will be evaluated using:

Operational Metrics
* Number of governance calls hosted
* % of calls documented and published within 72 hours
* Average response time to proposer requests

Proposal Quality
* % of proposals submitted without procedural rework
* Reduction in last-minute proposal issues

Participation & Transparency
* Number of unique proposers supported
* Governance call attendance
* Consistency of weekly governance communications

Process Integrity
* Adherence to governance timelines
* Public availability of documentation and records


# 5. Current Status
The Governance Guild already exists and is operational.

This proposal is a continuity request, not a new initiative. It builds directly on the previously approved Governance Guild proposal and aligns with Celo’s decentralization roadmap by enabling stakeholders to operate in parallel rather than hierarchically.

The Celo Governance Guardians compensation is calculated based on a weekly working effort of 25 for leading and 20 for regular guardians. Hours denominated in $USDm

The Budget will be managed in a Multi Sign designed to have three members part of the proposal and one member from the Celo Foundation (TBA) in guarantee of good working conditions.

**Multisign Address *(Threshold 2/3)*:**
0xc733285e8e4db433d4cd641f99C46Bf108DCb54F

**Signers:**
- 0xj4an: 0xFEF5A1A2b3754A2F53161EaaAcb3EB889F004d4a

# 8. Payment Terms
Two payments *(One each semester)* with the total budget of each semester that will cover Celo Governance Guild compensation, training, and community engagement initiatives. Payments will be distributed monthly, with performance-based reviews to ensure the program's objectives are met effectively.

The payment will be in Celo due to the Community Fund contract holding the majority of available funds in CELO. We use a 90-day rolling average to determine the price, which smooths out short-term volatility and provides a fair valuation for grant disbursement. 

Based on this 90-day average, Celo is valued at approximately **$0.151 USD**, implying that to fully cover the requested **$60,400 USD** budget, approximately **401,000 - 414,000 Celo** would be required *(including a ~3% buffer for price movement and execution)*. However, when testing a real swap on-chain using the USDm/Celo pool, the executable rate is currently **~8.55 Celo per 1 USDm *(≈$0.117 per Celo)***. At this rate, approximately **516,000 Celo** would be needed to realize the full **$60,400 USD** budget. We are therefore requesting **~532,000 Celo**, aligning with the current executable on-chain rate plus a ~3% buffer for price movement. 

Presenting both the 90-day average and the real-time executable price ensures transparency for governance and guarantees that the program is properly funded regardless of market depth or execution slippage.

## Overview

CGP 85 - G\$ oracle whitelisting

* G\$ is a token distributed as UBI, making it a gas token can help further easily onboard users to web3 without the need to hold "Celo" or other "Stables" that the user would otherwise need to purchase.
* G\$ is "stable enough", see dashboard in links for its price history.

### Status

In this governance proposal we porpose the whitelisting and funding of G\$ oracles.

Oracles will be enabled to report for CELO/G\$ ticker and funded from the community fund with 100 CELO to cover for gas fees. Proposed oracle addresses are:
1. `0x6AE2549301BF56198A22d814e921ba3E2ACD1d5C`

## Proposed Changes

1. Whitelist oracles
  - Destination: SortedOracles.addOracle
  - Data: `0x62B8B11039FcfE5aB0C56E502b1C372A3d2a9c7A`, `0x6AE2549301BF56198A22d814e921ba3E2ACD1d5C`)
  - Value: 0
2. Funding oracle address `0x6AE2549301BF56198A22d814e921ba3E2ACD1d5C`
  - Destination: GoldToken.transfer
  - Data: `0x62B8B11039FcfE5aB0C56E502b1C372A3d2a9c7A`, 100e18 (100 CELO)
  - Value: 0 (it's actually `0` as this was implemented as a token transfer)

## Verification

A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command:

```
celocli governance:show --proposalID 83
```

## Risks
This proposal is relatively low risk as G\$ is still not whitelisted as gas token

### Proposal Description
A more detailed version of our proposal can be found in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBDkeSIAyFBD-W_q_SkNN2wbCb-97LByK-fqR3KbuSM/edit?usp=sharing)

**Summary** 
In line with the Celo Governance Seasons Strategy and updates ([1](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-governance-seasons-a-conversation-about-governance-evolution-ahead-of-cel2-migration/10055), [2](https://forum.celo.org/t/updates-on-celo-governance-evolution-and-roadmap/11440)) and [Vision 2030](https://blog.celo.org/celebrating-celos-five-years-vision-2030-a-trillion-dollar-onchain-economy-built-on-celo-a-dc97f5f53132), this proposal aims to fund ‘CeloPG Season 1’ — a builder team dedicated to attracting, nurturing, and growing projects on Celo to regenerate the network and treasury while creating the conditions for prosperity.

We achieve this by building on our existing programs and key partnerships, which provide essential resources and support to Celo Projects and Builders across various stages of their maturity cycle.

This funding proposal requests approval of up to 288,500 cUSD, 875,000 CELO, and 250,000 OP to invest in key programs and sustain initiatives until December 31, 2025.

**CeloPG Season 1 Core Programs**

To win, Celo has to continue to attract and retain the best talent and supporting resources to the ecosystem. Below is a visualization of how the Celo Public Goods Funding Programs and Tools contribute to a Celo ecosystem growth flywheel that nurtures and attracts resources to grow the ecosystem value and treasury.

**Season 1 Objectives and Deliverables**
To Attract, Nurture, and Grow projects on Celo to regenerate the network and treasury while creating the conditions for prosperity and support Vision 2030, we’ve established the following milestones:

**1. Ensure wide adoption and efficiency of our ecosystem programs:** KPI: Have at least 70% of all active projects on Celo benefit from at least 1 CeloPG Program in H2.

**2. Amplifying Celo resources for builder programs:** Ensure that all program resources are allocated to Celo-aligned builders who continue to provide value to Celo and attract third-party resources to increase the ROI of our programs. KPI: Aim to attract at least 50% of extra resources to the Builder Programs.

**3. Grow the Celo Network Value:** Contribute to attracting and growing the value of the Celo Network and Celo Ecosystem treasury, measured by an increase in Chains revenue, relative share of chain revenue connected to at least 1 CeloPG program, and tokens bridges to, launched on and contributed to the Celo Ecosystem Treasury in H2.  


**Specification**
CeloPG Season 1 consists of eight interconnected line items, each with its own focus and budget.

**A. Celo Support Streams**
The protocol incentive flywheel is built on the learnings of Celo Support Streams Season 0. The mechanism switches to use stCELO as input to keep the Celo productive and staked while switching from bi-weekly vote cycles to continuous voting. Rewards will be issued in CELO on Celo Mainnet and OP on Optimism Mainnet.

**B. Proof of Ship**
Monthly builder grants to projects on Celo who meet certain milestones and progress criteria reported through Karma and reviewed by the Celo DevRel team.

**C. Celo Impact Rewards**
Building on the initial Celo Impact Rewards pilot with Divvi, CeloPG will issue monthly impact rewards based on key measurables of impact and project maturity, such as gas fees contributed, unique verified users, onchain revenue, and total value processed. Rewards will be issued in CELO on Celo Mainnet and OP on Optimism Mainnet.

**D. Season 1 Contributor Rewards**
Seasonal Contributor Rewards are allocated to individuals based on a set of impact activities measured through Prosperity Pass badges, curated in collaboration with the Foundation Growth team and all Celo Community Treasury-funded teams.

**E. CeloPG Development Grants**
Direct milestone-based grants for the development of software on Celo in line with the CeloPG program and ecosystem requirements. Distributed via Allo. Karma and Prosperity Pass as the primary solution to fund and develop further in Season 1.

**F. Treasury, Marketing and Events**
Maintain and enhance the Celo Community Treasury Dune Dashboard and Sheets, delivering regular updates on treasury status to key stakeholders and the community forum, along with proposed seasonal budgets. Support the design and development of ecosystem tools and resources, including the celopg.eco platform, visual assets, merchandise, and documentation. Allocate budget for CeloPG representation at relevant events and for organizing or sponsoring events aligned with CeloPG’s mission.

**G. CeloPG Operations**
Reward for the core and on-demand CeloPG contributors responsible for the design, support, and execution of the Celo Ecosystem Programs. Includes legal and accounting costs related to operating the initiative through the Regenerative Finance Foundation, a non-profit organization that has collaborated with Celo on ecosystem development since 2022.

**H. Celo x Gitcoin Strategic Rounds**
CeloPG is a strategic partner of Gitcoin and actively participates in the [Gitcoin 3.0 strategy sprint](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-3-0-gitcoin-grants-3-0-strategy-sprint-owocki-edition/20408) to play a key role in the next phase of Gitcoin and lead the solution development of at least two of Ethereum’s largest problem domains, in line with Celo’s vision and strengths.

While the exact domain scopes are to be ratified later, we are prioritizing two domains:
- ETH Localism: Physical ecosystems such as Crecimiento, Celo Africa, and CeLatam to run focused programs for driving regional development. This program builds on the successful [Regen Coordination](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/) and [Ethereum Localism](https://www.ethereumlocalism.xyz/) movement and rounds. To increase impact and long-term sustainability, the program will prioritize movements that can gain co-matching from their local stakeholders and develop/use onchain tools that drive meaningful usage of Celo.

A detailed program proposal will be shared in the coming week on the Gitcoin forum.

- ETH For The World: Real-world development through onchain applications and programs for projects such as Pretium and EthicHub to build new solutions or expand to new markets. The programs build on the successful [Real World Builder round hosted in GG21](https://www.celopg.eco/insights/gg21) by CeloPG. View a detailed program draft on the [Gitcoin forum here.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ethereum-for-the-world-dda-report-draft/21123)

We aim to raise a combined amount of USD 500K for these two programs, with approximately 30% coming from the Celo Community Treasury.

Both rounds would run on Celo and optimize for progressing Celo’s Season 1 Intent. To further accelerate the impact of these programs, we’ll run marketing campaigns around these rounds, such as EF-funded ETH FTW case studies and an event in BA, and leverage Prosperity Pass and Regenerative to attract protocol deployments and tokens to Celo.

In line with [Gitcoin's future vision](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-3-2-accelerating-gtc-value-capture/21086/1), we’ll also use these rounds to gain valuable insights for a potential Celo Ecosystem Fund, to provide the Celo Ecosystem Treasury with upside in promising projects in exchange for access to the CeloPG programs.

The amount of funds allocated in GG24 is dependent on our ability to gain co-matching and perceived round impact on key Celo metrics and long-term ecosystem growth.

**Budget Breakdown (7)**

||CELO|cUSD|OP|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**CeloPG Team (9)**
Based on the current scope of CeloPG and our learnings from running two cycles, we identified that program execution is the most critical function in the CeloPG team, such - we’ve gathered a balanced team of 3 contributors, all being builders themselves and two advisors who have deep context from the Celo Ecosystem and Public Goods funding at large.

## Risks
- This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.
- This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 9. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v9). Verilog have completed an audit of release 9, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v9) for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)

- `Attestations`: `1.1.1.2` => `1.2.0.0`
- `Election`: `1.1.1.2` => `1.1.3.0`
- `GoldToken`: `1.1.1.1` => `1.1.2.0`
- `Governance`: `1.2.1.1` => `1.3.0.0`
- `LockedGold`: `1.1.2.0` => `1.1.2.1`
- `Validators`: `1.2.0.3` => `1.2.0.4`

## Verification

First make sure to download latest [celo-monorepo]([url](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/)) with

`git clone git@github.com:celo-org/celo-monorepo.git`

or to pull latest if downloaded previously:

`git pull`

then build it with:

`yarn && yarn build`

Once built, cd to the protocol folder with 

`cd packages/protocol`

From there you can download the current proposal:

```bash
../cli/bin/run governance:show --proposalID 106 --jsonTransactions release-9-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Alternatively you can use the CLI distrubuted via npm, but make sure to have version 1.7.0 or higher (with `npm -g install @celo/celocli@1.7.0`). The command above will start with `celocli` instead of `../cli/bin/run` then.


And then verify that the proposal deployment matches audited release:

```
yarn verify-release -p release-9-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v9 -n mainnet -f -i "releaseData/initializationData/release9.json"
```

The output should verify that the bytecodes and storages match what is expected.

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

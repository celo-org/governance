Proposal Description
============================

This proposal is a proxy governance proposal that mirrors Mento Governance Proposal 10 (MGP-10).
As part of the ongoing coordination between the Celo community and the Mento community, Celo token holders
have the opportunity to vote in Mento Governance with the Celo Community fund Mento Allocation.

The original MGP-10 can be found here: [MGP-10: Restructuring the Mento Reserve Yield on Mento Reserve & Mento Funding](https://forum.mento.org/t/mgp-10-restructuring-the-mento-reserve-yield-on-mento-reserve-mento-funding/93)

This CGP does not introduce new changes beyond those specified in MGP-10. Instead, it acts as the execution layer within the Celo governance system, ensuring proper alignment between the two governance processes.

Abstract
============================
MGP-10 proposes restructuring how the yield generated by the Mento Reserve is allocated. Under the proposal, 
a portion of the reserve yield will be directed toward the Mento Reserve itself, 
while another portion will fund Mento protocol development and operations. 
This restructuring is designed to ensure that the Reserve remains robust while also providing 
sustainable and transparent funding for the ongoing growth of the Mento protocol.

Motivation
============================

The Mento protocol depends on both the financial health of the Reserve and a reliable source of funding for 
protocol development and ecosystem support. Until now, the distribution of yield has lacked a clear, 
sustainable structure. MGP-10 introduces a framework that balances the Reserveâ€™s long-term stability 
with the need for predictable, transparent funding.

Key motivations include:
- Strengthening the Mento Reserve to support long-term protocol stability.
- Establishing a dedicated, recurring funding mechanism for protocol operations.
- Improving transparency around how Reserve yield is used.
- Aligning incentives between protocol sustainability and community-driven development.


Specification
============================
The full specification, including parameters, rationale, and implementation details, is defined in MGP-10: [MGP-10: Restructuring the Mento Reserve Yield on Mento Reserve & Mento Funding](https://forum.mento.org/t/mgp-10-restructuring-the-mento-reserve-yield-on-mento-reserve-mento-funding/93)

This CGP acts as a binding proxy and does not alter or reinterpret the contents of MGP-10. The on-chain governance vote on this CGP will execute the decisions described in MGP-10.

## Transaction Descriptions

No transactions, a yes/no vote will be carried out by the approvers depending on the outcome of the CGP.

Risks
============================
- Reserve sustainability risk: If Reserve yield underperforms relative to expectations, funding allocations could be reduced, potentially impacting protocol operations.
- Protocol funding risk: If too much emphasis is placed on Reserve growth, protocol funding may fall short of supporting needed development.
- Governance risk: Future adjustments may be needed if external conditions (e.g., Reserve performance, market changes) shift the balance between sustainability and funding.

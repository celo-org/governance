## Overview

This proposal outlines the final steps for the launch of the Kenyan Shilling stablecoin (cKES), proposed by Celo Africa DAO, on the Mento platform. The introduction of cKES aims to empower Kenya's rapidly growing digital economy by providing a familiar, user-friendly, and accessible stablecoin.

The proposal includes transactions that when executed will do the following:

- Launch and initialize cKES
- Create and configure the cKES/cUSD pool
- Configure trading limits and circuit breakers

For a detailed explanation of the transactions involved in this process, please refer to the following forum post: https://forum.celo.org/t/draft-launch-of-a-kenyan-shilling-stablecoin/7964/2

## Verification

## Risks

There are couple of risks factors to take into account when launching new stablecoin like cKES :

- Data providers report the price that is different from the actual KES/USD exchange rate.

In conjunction with the Mento team the contract changes have been thoroughly tested, in addition to putting tight limits and circuit breakers during the initial launch phase to protect the Mento Reserve and cKES holders.

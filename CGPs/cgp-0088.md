# CELO Korea Proposal

**Proponent :**

Hope Lee, Alex Shin


**Requested CELO :**

USD 150,000 equivalent of 303,030 CELO


**Initial contributors/advisors :**

- Hope Lee – founder ReFi Korea
- Danny - DAO Cartographer
- Alex Shin - prev. Co founder Hashed


**Short description:**
Celo Korea aims to mobilize local talent to build awareness and communities that align with Celo’s mission. Despite South Korea having the largest trading volume of CELO, there are no local community activities or press highlighting Celo’s ongoing efforts. This opens an opportunity to introduce “ReFi ,” which can counteract the negative perceptions around crypto following the recent downtown and highlight the potential for positive social impact, which we believe is timely and important.

By aligning the Celo narrative with key themes around ESG, social impact, blockchain thought leaders, and introducing ideas like regenerative finance – the objective is to foster positive change and enhance Celo’s credibility locally.

---

# 1. Situation
Korea frequently has the highest trading volume for CELO, yet visibility around Celo Foundation’s efforts and our community at large is non-existent.

Korea is a highly active and mature market for cryptocurrency. As shifts in global macro sentiment towards crypto are being questioned, leading ideas in our industry are being questioned as well, particularly in Korea where cryptocurrency adoption and speculation rates are among the highest. This presents a grassroots opportunity to introduce a new narrative.

Currently, Gamefi, Defi, and NFTs all have negative connotations. By dissociating Celo from financial upside and gambling and introducing ideas around prosperity and regenerative finance, we are confident that we can get both corporate and government attention and involvement, expediting Celo’s mission.

One of the challenges we have faced as a market is that Korea has always been the liquidity and price action market for western protocols. The market has been burned many times over, and Celo can present a different narrative.

# 2. Proposal Objectives

## 2.1 How we will do this

**Milestone 1: Content Localization**
Take everything Celo has done thus far + future announcements (ie, new product etc) and have it localized and delivered through effective channels.

**Milestone 2: Community**

**Milestone 3: PR and Education Content**
Come up with media coverage around Celo, conduct technical research and provide resources ie: educational content, localized technical documentation.

**Milestone 4: Partnerships/Products**
Once we build out CELO’s position in Korea, certain projects built on CELO can potentially be localized and launched here. If ESG narrative grows, there’s many corporate budgets and government initiatives around ESG we may be able to qualify for.

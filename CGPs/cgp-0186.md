## Overview

This proposal is the second part of the Mento Oracles Migration, following [CGP184](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0184.md). While the first proposal focused on removing existing whitelisted addresses from the SortedOracles contract, this proposal completes the migration by whitelisting the new Chainlink relayers, configuring the correct report expiry parameters and re-creating the affected pools.

In addition, 3 new Chainlink relayers will be whitelisted ahead of time to be used in a future Mento Upgrade proposal:

1. EUR/USD [(0xC4918A76A7fdB113f2dFa9B162e875f271A2f7b8)](https://celoscan.io/address/0xC4918A76A7fdB113f2dFa9B162e875f271A2f7b8)
2. BRL/USD [(0x6322A90B468C14d1091CC91bC42FAd5584312220)](https://celoscan.io/address/0x6322A90B468C14d1091CC91bC42FAd5584312220)
3. XOF/USD [(0xF2772e9EF0C1bc2794f7c21cf35843391bC32A5A)](https://celoscan.io/address/0xF2772e9EF0C1bc2794f7c21cf35843391bC32A5Aa).

## Proposed Changes

This proposal will implement the following changes for each affected rate feed:

- Whitelist new Chainlink relayer addresses in SortedOracles
- Set the correct tokenReportExpiry in sortedOracles.
- Destroy and recreate the associated pool with updated configuration:
  - Set `minimumReports` to `1`
  - Update `referenceRateResetFrequency` to `6 minutes`
  - Optionally implement new values for `spread` and `stablePoolResetSize`

## Verification

Please refer to the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-oracles-migration/11270) for a detailed description of verification steps.

## Risks

This migration comes with inherent risks related to data quality, uptime considerations, and potential technical difficulties. However, we have conducted extensive historical data analysis comparing all oracle providers, which confirms that Chainlink and Redstone's data quality and report frequency/uptime meet our requirements. Additionally, Mento V2's on-chain circuit breaker architecture provides an additional layer of protection against price discrepancies.

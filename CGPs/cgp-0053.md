## Overview

CGP - Celo Governance Proposal

This proposal sets the block gas limit parameter of the Celo blockchain to 35M from 20M. The change is motivated by the improvement on block processing thoughput with the latest celo-blockchain releases.

The most relevant changes that possitivily impact the performance of the network are:

- [Snapshots](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/)
- [CIP43: Block Context](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0043.md)

For confirming the safety and stabilty of a block gas limit of 35M, cLabs Blockchain Team have run loat and stability testing during the last weeks.

The change will increase the transaction thorughput by way of the increasing the block space by 75%, and also will increase the effective network target block for adjunsting the baseFee, that currently is 0.8 * blockSize.

## Proposed Changes

1. Increase the block gas limit parameter:

- Destination: Call `setBlockGasLimit` on the `BlockchainParameters` smart contract owned by `Governance`
- Data: 35 000 0000 (35 Million)
- Value: 0 (NA)

## Testing

To check and validate the performance of the networks under high pressure of gas consumption, a Celo testnet was deployed with the following parameters:

- Running validators: 110
- Elected validators: 110
- Proxied validators: 10
- Block time: 5 seconds
- Epoch: Each 17280 blocks
- Celo-blockchain version: 1.5.5
- Celo-monorepo (protocol) version: f62781066e5534d591c65bbcea8592cfb90d3a56
- Validator resources: CPU = 8 vCPUs (n2 GCP platoform); Memory = 32GiB
- Proxy resources: CPU = 4 vCPUs (n2 GCP platoform); Memory = 16GiB
- Block Gas Limit illustrated in this results: 40 million (vs 35M as proposed)
- The network was running on "preemptible" instances that can eventually be restarted by the cloud provider.

The load transactions were generated as token transfers, transfering different tokens and also using different currencies for paying the transaction fees. The network were running with a continued 40M load for 35 hours.

As summury for the results we illustrate some of the metrics for a 110 validator network, with 40M block size, running on GCP n2-standard-8 (8vCPU and 32 GiB memory).

The previous image represents how the block time (5 seconds) is splitted between the different steps of block construction and block consensous. Most of the block time is spent in `consensus_istanbul_backend_sleep`, that represents idle time.

For a 40M block size, a full node running on n2-standard-4 (4vCPU and 16 GiB memory) can keep synced without problems:

In the previous graph is represented the block delta between the network block head, and the latest block form each node. As show, none of the instances distanced more than two blocks from the head, and part of this can be caused by different timing with the metric probe.

Lastly this image shows the per-second average of new blocks.

In the view of the results showing stability in all the observed metrics, we can reach the conclusion that the network can handle an increament on the gas block limit to 35M without notoriously impacting the average block time.

## Verification

TODO

## Risks

- While metrics in the testing environment indicated that consensus and block production remain within expected bounds, generally speaking, increases in block space mean higher computational needs which could impact consensus and block production under adversarial conditions that were not tested.
- Increasing the block space could lead to a quicker growth of chain state which in the long run makes running full nodes more resource-intenstive and could affect decentralization adversely.

## Overview

CGP - Celo Governance Proposal

This proposal sets the block gas limit parameter of the Celo blockchain from `20M` to `50M` and the gasPriceMinimum's targetDensity from `0.8` to `0.7`. The change is motivated by the improvement on block processing throughput with the latest celo-blockchain releases.

The most relevant changes that positively impact the performance of the network are:

- [Snapshots](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/)
- [CIP43: Block Context](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0043.md)

For confirming the safety and stability of a block gas limit of `50M`, cLabs Blockchain Team have run load and stability testing during the last weeks.

The change will increase the transaction throughput by way of the increasing the block space by 150%, and also will increase the effective network target block for adjusting the baseFee, that currently is `0.8 * blockSize` (`16M`) and will be `0.7 * blockSize` (`35M`).

## Proposed Changes

1. Increase the block gas limit parameter:

    - Destination: Call `setBlockGasLimit` on the `BlockchainParameters` smart contract owned by `Governance`
    - Data: 50 000 000 (50 Million)
    - Value: 0 (NA)

2. Decrease the gasPriceMinimum's target density:

    - Destination: Call `setTargetDensity` on the `GasPriceMinimum` smart contract owned by `Governance`
    - Data: 700 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (7e23 => 0.7)
    - Value: 0 (NA)

## Testing

To check and validate the performance of the networks under high pressure of gas consumption, a Celo testnet was deployed with the following parameters:

- Running validators: 110
- Elected validators: 110
- Proxied validators: 10
- Block time: 5 seconds
- Epoch: Each 500 blocks
- Celo-blockchain version: 1.5.5
- Celo-monorepo (protocol) version: f62781066e5534d591c65bbcea8592cfb90d3a56
- Validator resources: CPU = 8 vCPUs (n2 GCP platform); Memory = 32GiB
- Proxy resources: CPU = 4 vCPUs (n2 GCP platform); Memory = 16GiB
- Block Gas Limit illustrated in these results: 50 million
- The network was running on "preemptible" instances that can eventually be restarted by the cloud provider (this causes some outsiders in the graphs caused by pod restarts)

The load transactions were generated as token transfers, transferring different tokens and also using different currencies for paying the transaction fees. The network were running with a continued 50M load for 24 hours in different intervals.

As summary for the results, we illustrate some metrics for a 110 validator network, with 50M block size, running on GCP n2-standard-8 (8vCPU and 32 GiB memory).

![Block Processing Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5635989/167684677-a8758d16-9998-4c11-98a7-9cf5dabdef37.png)

The previous image represents how the block time (~5 seconds), split between the different steps of block construction and block consensus. The time spent in `consensus_istanbul_backend_sleep`, that represents idle time for the block time.

For a 50M block size, a full node running on n2-standard-4 (4vCPU and 16 GiB memory) can keep synced without problems:

In the previous graph is represented the block delta between the network block head, and the latest block from each node. As show, none of the instances distanced more than one blocks from the head, and part of this can be caused by different timing with the metric probe (the spike shown in the graph was caused to a restart of the preemptible instance).

Lastly, this image shows the per-second average of new blocks.

In the view of the results showing stability in all the observed metrics, we can reach the conclusion that the network can handle an increment on the gas block limit to 50M without negatively impacting the average block time.

As a precautionary measure, taking into account that the stress tests performed are not fully representative of all the possible usages of the network, we are also suggesting to change the gasPriceMinimum `target density` to `0.7`, to discourage long periods of stress on the network, making virtually impossible to fill more than 10 minutes of full blocks due to the high costs it would require.

The proposed change would allow the network to maintain a constant flow of usage of 35M per block (without any price change), and absorb the high peaks of transactions without compromising the network.

As an example, if we stress the network and fill every block for 5 consecutive minutes, the gas price multiplier would be `~4.4k`, and as the `gasPriceMinimumFloor` right now is `1e8` wei it means that the `gasPriceMinimum` would increase to `~4.4e11` after those 5 minutes. Which translates that a `100k` gas tx, would require to pay a fee of `4.4e16` => `0.044 celos`.

The same example but with 10 consecutive minutes of full block (`120 blocks`), it translates to a `~19200k` multiplier. That same tx will cost `192 celos`. This scenario is highly improbable except in a network attack, and it will be normalized again with a faster pace (59 consecutive blocks 20% full, for example)

As another example, a pattern load of 8 consecutive full blocks, followed by 2 consecutive blocks at 20% (10 blocks in total) maintained for 10 minutes (120 blocks, 12 of those cycles) translates to a multiplier in the bigger peak of `~1.2k`, which for a `100k` gas tx would require a tx fee of `0.012 celos`

## Verification

* Confirm the proposal: celocli governance:view --proposalID 57
* After execution confirm that the `blockGasLimit` of the `BlockchainParameters` contract changed from 20000000 to 50000000: https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x6E10a8864C65434A721d82e424d727326F9d5Bfa/read-proxy
* Also verify that the `targetDensity` of the `GasPriceMinimum` contract changed from 500000000000000000000000 to 700000000000000000000000: https://explorer.celo.org/address/0xDfca3a8d7699D8bAfe656823AD60C17cb8270ECC/read-proxy

## Risks

- While metrics in the testing environment indicated that consensus and block production remain within expected bounds, generally speaking, increases in block space mean higher computational needs which could impact consensus and block production under adversarial conditions that were not tested.
- Increasing the block space could lead to a quicker growth of chain state, which in the long run makes running full nodes more resource-intensive and could affect decentralization adversely.

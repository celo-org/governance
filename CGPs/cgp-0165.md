# Celo Communities Guild Proposal | 2025 H1 Budget

Proposal Key Aspects
====================

*   **Receiver Entity:** Celo Governance   
*   **Status**:[FINAL]
*   **Title**: Celo Communities Guild Proposal | 2025 H1 Budget
*   **Author(s):** Celo communities Guild: Goldo _(@0xGoldo)_, 0xj4an-work _(@_0xj4an-work_)_, Anthony _(@0xKnight)_
*   **Type of Request:** Funding
*   **Funding Request:** We are requesting from the Community Fund 47,090 cUSD + 5,000 Celo for six months of operations.
    

Summary
=======
This proposal outlines the request for funding to sustain and enhance the Celo Communities Guild program across Discord, Telegram, Reddit, and X (Twitter) throughout 2025. Since its inception in August 2021, the initiative has received consistent support from the Celo Foundation, reflecting its recognition of the critical role community-focused moderation plays in fostering a safe, informative, and engaging environment.

In June 2024, following [extensive discussions](https://forum.celo.org/t/draft-celo-communities-guild-2024-h2-budget/8060) with community members and stakeholders, the Celo Moderators Guild was integrated into the CeloPG proposal for H2 2024. Since then, the program has operated under the CeloPG framework with significant autonomy.

As the Celo Foundation continues to decentralize its operations, this program remains pivotal in enabling the community to uphold safety and quality standards while proactively addressing misinformation and mitigating risks posed by malicious actors. By cultivating a collaborative and inclusive environment, the Celo Communities Guild actively supports the growth and long-term success of the ecosystem.

Motivation
==========
In blockchain technology, communities form the bedrock of growth, collaboration, and innovation. Platforms like Discord, Telegram, and Reddit are not just communication tools—they are dynamic spaces where users exchange knowledge, provide support, and collectively advance the ecosystem. These platforms are, in essence, public goods, shaped and maintained by the community for the community.

For a blockchain project like Celo, these spaces serve as both entry points for new users and support networks for seasoned participants. They are where ideas are born, questions are answered, and trust is cultivated. However, such open environments can also be breeding grounds for misinformation, scams, and unproductive discourse. This is where moderators become indispensable.

Moderators are the backbone of community quality—they guide conversations, provide timely and accurate assistance, and protect members from harmful actors. On platforms like Discord, moderators ensure real-time engagement and troubleshooting, creating a sense of connection for users. On Telegram, they manage fast-paced conversations and quickly address emerging concerns. Meanwhile, on Reddit, moderators curate in-depth discussions, helping new ideas gain visibility while keeping the conversation respectful and on-topic.

Moderators also play a vital role as the communication bridge between regional DAOs and the broader Celo ecosystem, ensuring seamless coordination and alignment. This is especially vital within the Discord server, where diverse voices from global communities converge. By acting as a unifying layer, moderators facilitate the flow of information, amplify updates from regional DAOs, and ensure that the ecosystem remains connected, cohesive, and inclusive. Their work strengthens the ties between localized efforts and the overarching vision of the Celo network.

This proposal underscores the necessity of continuing and enhancing the Celo Communities Guild initiative. A strong moderator team not only ensures the safety and well-being of community members but also fosters an environment of trust, collaboration, and shared values—key ingredients for the long-term success of the Celo ecosystem.

Objectives
----------
1.  **Enhance Community Engagement**: Foster meaningful interactions across platforms, ensuring a welcoming and vibrant community space.

4.  **Reward Participation**: Expand reward programs, such as NFT incentives and engagement-based recognition, to encourage active participation.
5.  **Facilitate Community Growth**: Support onboarding of new members, builders, and contributors to the Celo ecosystem.

*   Increase monthly active engagement across designated platforms.  
*   Track and reduce incidents of code of conduct violations.
*   Report on frequently asked questions and community sentiment trends monthly.

Current status
==============
Following a successful first six months operating under the CeloPG umbrella, this program now seeks renewal and expansion to align with the Celo Foundation’s strategic focus on decentralizing community management. The proposed funding aims to both sustain and scale the Celo Communities Guild’s efforts, accommodating the growing activity across existing platforms and expanding to new opportunities for community engagement.

Over the past six months (July–December), we have diligently tracked our expenses, which are transparently documented [\[here\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SEOnmhHipJ2WUQiANgzHTSsQrgR7TsWRlHcB_xsa820/edit?usp=sharing), and published detailed monthly reports [\[here\]](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-communities-guild-reports/8803). These records underscore our commitment to accountability and serve as a foundation for demonstrating the program’s value and impact.

Timeline and Milestones

*   Active moderation in Celo Guilds _(Discord, Telegram & Reddit)._
*   Hold a Bi-Weekly _Community Hangout_ call on Discord.

Team
====

From the outset, our vision has been to implement a rotational leadership structure, allowing team members to take on diverse roles and bring fresh perspectives every six months.

Looking ahead to H2 2025, the leadership will rotate again, with Anthony _(@0xKnight)_ assuming the Lead Moderator role, Goldo _(@0xGoldo)_ becoming the Security Moderator, and 0xj4an-work _(@0xj4an-work)_ serving as Moderator.

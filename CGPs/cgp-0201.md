## Proposal Description
This proposal requests funding from the Celo Community Fund to support six months (July–December 2025) of core protocol development by the cLabs team as part of the ongoing Season Planning. The focus is on scaling the Celo Layer 2 through critical infrastructure upgrades, enhanced data availability, fault-proof security, and crosschain interoperability. This proposal outlines key technical milestones, updated cost estimates, and a continued commitment to transparency and milestone-based reporting. These milestones reflect those shared in the recently published [Celo L2 roadmap](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-as-an-ethereum-l2-a-frontier-chain-for-global-impact/11376).


### **Background**

Since transitioning to an Ethereum Layer 2, Celo has entered a new phase of technical development focused on scaling the L2's throughput, improving security as well as L2Beat's rating of Celo, and adding modular capabilities. With the initial upgrade complete, the cLabs team is now focused on delivering the milestones outlined in the post-transition roadmap, including protocol upgrades and integrations with modular infrastructure like Succinct and EigenDA V2.

Following the successful L2 transition, the cLabs team successfully activated the Isthmus hardfork on Mainnet, bringing the L2 stack in line with Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade and laying the groundwork for future enhancements. Upcoming work includes the integration of EigenDA V2, the launch of a new long-lived testnet aligned with Ethereum’s Sepolia (to replace Alfajores after the Holesky sunset), and an evaluation of fast finality solutions like Espresso to improve confirmation speed and crosschain interoperability.


### **Milestones for the Next 6 Months**

### **Funding Request**

To deliver on these milestone, this proposal seeks funding for the following budget line items:

|                                |                                                                                                                    |                      |
| :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------: |
|        **Cost Category**       |                                                     **Details**                                                    | **Total Cost (USD)** |
| Fully Loaded Engineering Costs | 20 full-time contributors focused on core protocol development (13), devops (2), security (3), and dev tooling (2) |      $1,979,774      |
|     Infrastructure & Tools     |                                  Cloud services, testnet hosting, analytics tools                                  |        $90,000       |

|              Total             |                                                                                                                    |      $2,129,774      |

Note that cLabs will continue to self fund personnel costs related to senior management, finance, legal, people ops, and marketing as well as office, hardware, travel, and other expenses.\
\
Based on the 90-day average CELO price ($0.33 from April 17–July 15, 2025), this totals 6,453,860 CELO, distributed over six monthly installments of 1,075,643.33 CELO, subject to a two-month cliff.


### **Transparency and Accountability**

Consistent with previous cLabs funding proposals, we propose that all funds be disbursed through a ReleaseCelo smart contract with a 2-month cliff and linear vesting thereafter. If milestone commitments are not met, a governance proposal can revoke the contract and return unvested funds to the Community Fund.

Progress updates will be published on the Celo Forum and cLabs will continue to engage ecosystem stakeholders and governance participants to ensure development remains aligned with the network’s needs and Ethereum’s L2-centric scaling roadmap.\
\
**Conclusion**\
\
Together, these milestones will strengthen Celo’s Layer 2 ecosystem, enhance alignment with Ethereum, and drive continued innovation across our community.\
 
## Proposed Changes
 
Fill out the following template for each transaction in the proposal
 
1. Fund the Release Contract
  - Goldtoken.transfer
  - Data: transfer(address to = `0x65E25C46cB80ae5F8118D6BcFa3B69d969799411`, uint256 value = `6453860000000000000000000` (aprox 6.5M Celo))
  - Value: 0 (It's send as a ERC20, not as a native transfer)
 
## Verification
 
Before approving/voting, fetch the on-chain proposal and verify that the destination address matches the address of the ReleaseGold contract, `0x65E25C46cB80ae5F8118D6BcFa3B69d969799411` and that the amount is  6,453,860 CELO, equivalent to 2792440000000000000000000 or 6.453861e24.

$ celocli governance:show --proposalID TODO -n https://forno.celo.org

Then verify that the same contract is a ReleaseGold contract with parameters that match the proposal:

$ celocli releasecelo:show --contract 0x65E25C46cB80ae5F8118D6BcFa3B69d969799411 -n https://forno.celo.org

In particular check these parameters:
```
releaseOwner: 0xD533Ca259b330c7A88f74E000a3FaEa2d63B7972 # check this is GovernanceProxy address by copy-pasting into Explorer: allows Governance to revoke the grant
beneficiary: 0x8c7510C66f1BbF8f700a2665c898b3FB77550E38 # cLabs self-custodied account
releaseSchedule:
  amountReleasedPerPeriod: 1075643163333333333333333 (~1.076e+24) #  6 times this value plus 1 CELO equals total grant (contract sends 1 CELO when beneficiary registers a vote signing key)
  releasePeriod: 1 month, 10 hours # monthly vesting
  numReleasePeriods: 6 # 6 month total vest
  releaseCliff: Sat, Aug 30, 2025, 10:00 PM GMT+2 # 2 month cliff
  releaseStartTime: Tue, Jul 1, 2025, 2:00 AM GMT+2 # release start time
```

## Risks
 
This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.

This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund. The major risk is an incorrect destination address that would leave the funds in the wrong account, or an incorrect releaseOwner on the ReleaseGold account. So long as those are correct, if any other parameter is incorrect, the contract can be revoked, the funds returned, and the grant reissued.

## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to add oracles for the USDC/USD rate as this rate is required for the upcoming Multi-Collateral Mento upgrade (see [Multi-Collateral Mento forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-core-contract-upgrade-1-multi-collateral-mint/4942/4)). The set of oracle providers proposed is the same as the oracle providers for the existing rates, that is CELO/USD, CELO/EUR and CELO/BRL.

So far, Mento stables can only be be directly issued and redeemed against CELO. Multi-Collateral Mento will allow users to directly issue and redeem Mento stables against additional reserve assets. The first additional pair we aim to suggest after the Multi-Collateral Mento upgrade is the cUSD/USDC pair. A USDC/USD oracle rate is required to protect against the edge-case of a depegging of USDC when activating this pair in Multi-Collateral Mento.

### Status

USDC is not natively deployed on Celo and the USDC/USD oracle rate therefore needs to be associated with a bridged version of  USDC. Since we aim to propose the use of Axelar Wrapped USDC (axlUSDC) as the first additional reserve asset supported in Multi-Collateral Mento, this proposal suggests to associate the reported USDC/USD rates with the token address of axlUSDC (`0xeb466342c4d449bc9f53a865d5cb90586f405215`). 

This CGP proposes to enabled to enable the following addresses to report the USDC/USD rate and to fund those addresses from the community fund with 100 CELO each to cover for gas fees:
1. `XXX`
2. `XXX`
3. `XXX`
4. `XXX`
5. `XXX`
6. `XXX`
7. `XXX`
8. `XXX`
9. `XXX`
10. `XXX`

These addresses were provided by the current set of oracle providers and the oracle client distribution for the USDC/USD rate resembles the distribution of clients for the currently available rates (CELO/USD, CELO/EUR, CELO/BRL)

## Proposed Changes
1. Whitelist oracles
  - Destination: SortedOracles.addOracle
  - Data: `0xeb466342c4d449bc9f53a865d5cb90586f405215`, `XXX`)
  - Value: 0
2. Funding oracle address `XXX`
  - Destination: GoldToken.transfer
  - Data: `XXX`, 100e18 (100 CELO)

## Verification

A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command:

```
celocli governance:show --proposalID 71
```

## Risks
This proposal itself is relatively low risk as it simply adds an oracle rate that is not currently in use. It should be checked, and confirmed however by the current orcale providers,git stat that the oracles addresses listed in this proposal are correct to ensure the functioning and safity of the systems that will rely on this rate in the future.

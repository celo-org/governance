## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to add oracles for USDC/USD rate as these are required for the upcoming Multi-Collateral Mento upgrade (see [Multi-Collateral Mento forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-core-contract-upgrade-1-multi-collateral-mint/4942/4)). The set of oracle providers as the same as the oracle providers for the currently available rates, that is CELO/USD, CELO/EUR and CELO/BRL.

So far, Mento stables could only be be directly issued and redeemed against CELO. Multi-Collateral Mento will allow users to directly issue and redeem Mento stables against additional reserve assets. The first additional pair we aim to suggest after the Multi-Collateral Mento upgrade is the cUSD/USDC pair. For that, a USDC/USD oracle rate is required to protect against the edge-case of a depegging of USDC.

### Status

As USDC is not natively deployed on Celo and the USDC/USD oracle rate therefore needs to be associated with a bridged version of the USDC. Since we aim to propose the use of Axelar Wrapped USDC (axlUSDC) as the first additional reserve asset supported in Multi-Collateral Mento, this proposal suggests to associate the reported USDC/USD rates with the token addres of axlUSDC (`0xeb466342c4d449bc9f53a865d5cb90586f405215`). 

This CGP proposes to enabled to enable the following addresses to report the USDC/USD rate and to fund those addresses from the community fund with 100 CELO each to cover for gas fees:
1. `XXX`
2. `XXX`
3. `XXX`
4. `XXX`
5. `XXX`
6. `XXX`
7. `XXX`
8. `XXX`
9. `XXX`
10. `XXX`

These addresses were provided by the current set of oracle providers such that oracle client distribution for the USDC/USD rate resembles the distribution for the currently available rates (CELO/USD, CELO/EUR, CELO/BRL)

## Proposed Changes
1. Whitelist oracles
  - Destination: SortedOracles.addOracle

  - Value: 0
2. Funding oracle address `XXX`
  - Destination: GoldToken.transfer
  - Data: `XXX`, 100e18 (100 CELO)
  - Value: 0 (it's actually `0` as this was implemented as a token transfer)

## Verification

A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command:

```
celocli governance:show --proposalID 71
```

## Risks
This proposal itself is relatively low risk as it simply adds an oracle rate that is not currently in use. It should be checked and confirmed however by the current orcale providers that the oracles addresses listed in this proposal are correct to ensure the functioning and safity of the systems that will rely on this rate in the future.

## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to add oracles for the USDC/USD rate as this rate is required for the upcoming Multi-Collateral Mento upgrade (see [Multi-Collateral Mento forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-core-contract-upgrade-1-multi-collateral-mint/4942/4)). The set of oracle providers proposed is the same as the oracle providers for the existing rates, that is CELO/USD, CELO/EUR and CELO/BRL.

So far, Mento stables can only be directly issued and redeemed against CELO. Multi-Collateral Mento will allow users to directly issue and redeem Mento stables against additional reserve assets. The first additional pair we aim to suggest after the Multi-Collateral Mento upgrade is the cUSD/USDC pair. A USDC/USD oracle rate is required to protect against the edge-case of a depegging of USDC when activating this pair in Multi-Collateral Mento. 

### Status
We suggest in this proposal to associate the USDC/USD rate with the following identifier `0xA1A8003936862E7a15092A91898D69fa8bCE290c` which can be used after CGP execution to query the rate. We used the following algorithm to compute this identifier and suggest, for orderly process, the use of the same algorithm for additional rates in the future:

```solidity
address(uint160(uint256(keccak256("USDCUSD"))))
// == 0xA1A8003936862E7a15092A91898D69fa8bCE290c
```

We use this method because historically we've had stable asset reference prices only against `CELO`, like `CELO/USD` and `CELO/EUR` for example, and decided to use the stable asset address that the price feed servers as the oracle identifier. So, the `CELO/USD` price feed reported to the `cUSD` address, `CELO/EUR` price feed reported to the `cEUR` address, and so on. 
However, now that we're opening up trading against multiple collateral assets, we can't follow this pattern anymore. 
In the case of `cUSD`, we will have both a `CELO/cUSD` trading pair, using the `CELO/USD` price as reference, and a `USDC/cUSD` trading pair, using the `USDC/USD` price as reference. 
Both `CELO/USD` and `USDC/USD` are thus price feeds which serve the `cUSD` stable assets, but require independent oracle identifiers. Migrating away from using the address type as a reference identifier didn't feel worth it, therfore we came up with this formula to derive identifier addresses from ticker data. 


This CGP proposes to enabled to enable the following addresses to report the USDC/USD rate:

#### Mento Labs

1. `0x477185291403ca2ed5f56d59ed0d568a16222013`
2. `0x9a0a52d483c62df76d54f41ab3283cc7cb41ba91`
3. `0x2ddb86898a2c2c884fc5cc3ca344898b0170a00d`
4. `0x79be0a692e3a4bcd22b96c3e93a108b485becbb2`
5. `0x2986c21824c9b804d170270a316ceb07149f79c5`
6. `0x09e2e47bb5df7b3464407746970a65c7b02883b3`
7. `0xd5e7454932f6e853af849f70044570b62ca2596e`
8. `0xfe3276b7142dee2cda34b1d14852eb32f436483d`

#### Di Wu

9. `0x504C282C98fe9E7627DCE2c255E3BfF2eeB6e73e`

#### T-Systems

10. `0xF396A0dd57FAF581b609d4d195B6b61b70651f41`

These addresses were provided by the current set of oracle providers and the oracle client distribution for the USDC/USD rate resembles the distribution of clients for the currently available rates, that is CELO/USD, CELO/EUR and CELO/BRL.

## Verification

A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command (on-chain ID determined after submission):

```
celocli governance:show --proposalID <on-chain ID>
```

## Risks

This proposal itself is relatively low risk as it simply adds an oracle rate that is not currently in use. It should be checked, and confirmed however by the current oracle providers, that the oracle addresses listed in this proposal are correct to ensure the functioning and safety of the systems that will rely on this oracle rate in the future.

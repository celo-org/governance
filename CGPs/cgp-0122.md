## Overview

This CGP proposes two changes related to the Mento Reserve:
1. The addition of Tether stablecoins (USDT and EURT) as Mento Reserve collateral
2. The migration of the reserve-owned 20m cUSD/USDCet(portal) pool to a cUSD/USDC(native) pool 

A yes vote signals support for both of these actions. 

### Regarding 1.
The [Mento Reserve](https://reserve.mento.org/) represents a diversified portfolio of on-chain assets crucial for supporting the Mento Protocol’s ability to adjust the supply of Mento stable assets according to user demand. From community discussions, there seems to be consensus to further enhance the Reserve’s diversification. CGP #150, recently approved, endorsed diversifying into low-risk, reward-generating protocols. Consequently, the Reserve has already integrated staked ETH (Lido), stEUR (Angle Protocol), and sDAI (Spark Protocol) into its mix. Building upon the directives of [CGP #150](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/150), the Reserve now aims for a 1:1 backing of cUSD and cBRL in USDC and sDAI (at a 50/50 weighting), as well as a 1:1 backing of cEUR in EUROC and stEUR (at a 75/25 weighting).

Ever since [CGP #62](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/62), the main priority of the Mento Reserve has been to keep a 100% backing in other stablecoins (USDC and DAI initially, plus the later additions of EUROC and stEUR via [CGP #127](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/127) and [CGP #150](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/150) respectively.

This CGP proposes expanding the diversification of this stablecoin basket further by incorporating USDT and EURT into the mix. Specifically, it suggests adjusting the Reserve mandate to back cUSD and cREAL 1:1 in USDC, sDAI, and USDT (equally weighted at ⅓ each), while backing cEUR and eXOF 1:1 in EUROC, stEUR, and EURT (also equally weighted at ⅓ each). The CELO, BTC and ETH allocation of the Reserve, considered mostly backup-collateral at this point, shall remain passive unless it needs to be touched to regain a 1:1 backing in stablecoins or unless instructed otherwise via on-chain governance.

Since Tether’s USDT and EURT are not currently native to Celo, the Mento Reserve is instructed to hold them on Ethereum. Should Tether deploy native versions of USDT and EURT on Celo in the future, these would be utilized and Mento broker pairs against them could potentially be created.

### Regarding 2. 
Since [USDC is now natively available on Celo](https://www.circle.com/blog/usdc-now-available-on-celo), this CGP also proposes the migration of the [20m cUSD/USDCet(portal)](https://curve.fi/#/celo/pools/factory-v2-35/deposit) Curve pool which is owned by the Mento Reserve to an equivalent 20m cUSD/USDC(native) Curve pool to remove the now unnecessary bridge risk.

## Proposed Changes

No on-chain changes. This proposal is only providing instructions to the Mento Reserve.

## Verification

No on-chain changes.

## Risks

Regarding the addition of Tether stablecoins: Every asset bears risks. For USDC, USDT, EUROC and EURT the predominant risk is credit risk. At this point Tether is audited by [BDO Global](https://www.bdo.global/), which is confirming that the Tether reserves overcollateralize outstanding stable tokens (see [Tether Reserves and Audits](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#usdt)) for more details). Tether has also recently decreased collateral risk: 90% of the collateral are now held in cash and cash equivalents. I therefore believe that Tether has a beneficial risk profile and that diversifying the stablecoin basket further through the addition of Tether stablecoins, can decrease the overall risk of the reserve portfolio.

Regarding the migration of the [20m cUSD/USDCet(portal) Curve pool](https://curve.fi/#/celo/pools/factory-v2-35/deposit): The major risk with the current pool is bridge risk and this proposal would remove that risk. There is, however, always some level of operational risk when funds are moved.

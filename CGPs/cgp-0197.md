# Prezenti Season 1 Funding Request: Direct Grants
## Summary

This subsequent proposal is a request for a further continuation of funding for Prezenti, enabling us to provide the only regular direct grant funding within the ecosystem in Season 1. This is a necessary and critical pillar to ensuring Celo’s continued growth, attracting and retaining top-tier talent.

This proposal seeks approval to support the **Celo Season 1 intents**:
* Grow daily transactions on Celo
* Grow TVL on Celo

This approval is for **\$470,000 cUSD(In Celo's native token - CELO)** to support builders, founders, and projects that align with [Season 1](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-governance-season-1-intent/11573).

Prezenti has become a trusted part of the Celo ecosystem. Over the last 3 years, we have offered a stable, reliable way to direct community funds to individuals and projects driving thoughtful innovation. Small and medium-sized grants are essential to any thriving blockchain network, and Prezenti has previously ensured this vital support is always available on Celo and would like to continue this mission.

In our 2024 [retrospective](https://forum.celo.org/t/prezenti-2024-retrospective/9687), we highlighted the three phases of Prezenti, with 2025 identified as the year of "fusion." Below, we outline what Prezenti aims to achieve and support for the Celo Community in Season 1.

---
## Motivation
The Prezenti team will continue offering direct grants to the Celo Community for Season 1. This proposal is for the **second half of 2025 (August - December)** aligning with the Season 1 intent. We plan to:

* Continue to offer grants, fully aligned with Season 1.
* Ensure **100% alignment to supporting builders and programs** on their journey and facilitating a strong builder funnel.
* Increase collaboration with key stakeholders, including (but not exhaustive): **Celo Foundation (esp Dev Rel), Regional Hubs, Celo Camp, Celo PG, and venture capitalists**.
* Contribute to the **Celo ‘Seasons’ strategy** and support the changes for Governance 2.0, Season 2, and the L2.
* Refine and adapt our **grant funding application process** and mechanisms as needed.

---
## Specification
Prezenti would run:
* **One open grant round**
* **One closed ‘Boost’ funding round** (specific teams invited by the Celo Foundation)

Both are 100% focused on Season 1 intents.

### 1. Refined Grant Pools
For Season 1 we have **removed** the ‘Micro Pool’ (\$2k cUSD) and ‘Pilot Pool’ (\$10k cUSD).
After running 4 rounds with the ‘pool’ structure, we have decided these do **not map effectively** towards Celo’s builder funnel goals.

**Season 1 grant pools:**
* **Growth Pool (\$25,000):** Scaling and development *(Intent 1: Stage 2)*
* **Scale Pool (\$50,000):** Larger-scale initiatives *(Intent 1: Stage 3)*
* **NEW Boost Pool (\$10,000):** Offered over the full Season 1 duration, for teams invited by the Celo Foundation. Applicants must still pass review, KYC, and milestones.

---
### 2. Global Collaboration
* Strengthen partnerships with **Celo Foundation, Regional Hubs, Celo Camp, Celo PG**, and others.
* Drive **targeted communications**, e.g., host X Spaces with Regional DAOs.
* Trial expanding review teams to include **1+ personnel from Celo Foundation** (pro bono).
* Collaborate with VC funds (starting with **[Verda Ventures](https://verda.ventures/)/[Celo Camp](https://www.celocamp.com/)**) to connect promising grantees with downstream opportunities.
* Work closely with Celo Camp through **knowledge sharing and planning sessions**.

---
### 3. Expanded Reviewer Team
In previous rounds, **Regional DAOs** provided valuable local insight. Under the new framework, we will instead include **1–2 reviewers from the Celo Foundation** (pro bono) for on-the-ground perspective.

---
### 4. Strategy Input for 2026+
Prezenti will continue to be a **primary stakeholder and driver** of shaping ecosystem-wide grant offerings as Celo moves through the Seasons.

---

| Category        | No. of Grants | Cost per Grant | Total         |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| **Admin**       | -             | -              | **\$60,000**  |

| **Total**       |               |                | **\$470,000** |

---
### Administration
* **Administrative costs**: tools, software, finance/legal support, operations.
* **Steward remuneration** for core team.

**Monthly breakdown:**

| Month     | Steward    | Admin      | Total      |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Aug       | 6,900      | 2,000      | 8,900      |
| Sep       | 7,800      | 2,000      | 9,800      |
| Oct       | 12,000     | 2,000      | 14,000     |
| Nov       | 7,800      | 2,000      | 9,800      |
| Dec       | 5,500      | 2,000      | 7,500      |
| Closeout  | 0          | 10,000     | 10,000     |
| **Total** | **40,000** | **20,000** | **60,000** |

> Due to the nature of grant giving and the ongoing management required, we need a budget to be able to support ongoing grants past the December/January Season change as many grants do not deliver within the 4 month allocated timescale. Our current operations/administration pool currently has [$89,388](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=celo:0x03344b9FCDdE6BE2FEF42876dB8fDc0696Ec688F) cUSD (25/07/25). This is rolled over from previous funding rounds and acts as a necessary contingency buffer. If Prezenti was to close, any remaining funds would be returned to the community via the governance contract.

---
## Grant Operations
- Season 1 includes ongoing use of the [Charmverse](https://app.charmverse.io/invite/7ab890) platform for transparency.
- We use [Forti](https://forti.io/events) as the interactive platform to showcase our grantees to dogfood a previous Prezenti grantee and help them grow.
- We utilize KarmaGAP. Supporting the streamline with [Celo Public Goods](https://www.celopg.eco/) and the [Celo Dev Rel](https://x.com/CeloDevs) teams.
- We’ve applied for AWS credits to allow grantees to get added support in their early stages of growth where infrastructure costs can be a burden for some teams.

---
## Payment Terms
* Funds deposited to **Prezenti 2/3 Multisig** from Community Fund.
* Allocations made to individual Pool SAFEs.

**Multisig Wallets:**
* **Master:** `celo:0xA5c9389A0Ce1bFe24FF883E761Ff313225C77D44`
* **Growth Pool:** `celo:0x3C9a27cd6d3CaF595aa5088001482664215f8Da7`
* **Scale Pool:** `celo:0xd1e5488B44AF038f2B220D1e53f0Cb068904E3b3`
* **Boost Pool:** `tbc`
* **Admin Safe:** `celo:0x03344b9FCDdE6BE2FEF42876dB8fDc0696Ec688F`
* **ETH Safe:** `eth:0x03344b9FCDdE6BE2FEF42876dB8fDc0696Ec688F`

**The payment will be in CELO** due to the community fund contract holding the majority of available funds in CELO. **We use a 90‑day rolling average** to determine the price, which smooths out short‑term volatility and provides a fair valuation for grant disbursement.

Based on this 90‑day average, **CELO has traded between \$0.33–\$0.335 USD**, implying that to fully cover the requested **\$470,000 USD** budget, **approximately 1,362,000–1,382,000 CELO** would be required (including a 1.5–3% buffer for price movement and execution).

However, when testing a real swap on-chain using the **cUSD/CELO pool** (as shown in the attached screenshot), the executable rate is currently **\~3.716 CELO per 1 cUSD** (**≈\$0.269 per CELO**). At this rate, **approximately 1,746,267 CELO** would be needed to realize the full \$470,000 budget.

**We are therefore requesting 1,746,267 CELO**, aligning with the current executable on‑chain rate. Presenting both the 90‑day average and the real‑time executable price ensures transparency for governance and guarantees that the program is properly funded regardless of market depth or execution slippage.

**CELO Budget Calculation**

| Basis               | Rate (USD/CELO) | CELO Needed for \$470K |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 90‑day rolling avg  | \$0.33–\$0.335  | \~1,362,000–1,382,000  |
| On‑chain executable | \~\$0.269       | \~1,746,267            |

---

> *Using the on‑chain executable price ensures that the requested budget reflects real-world swap conditions, preventing underfunding of the program. Any excess CELO left after the funds have been exchanged will be returned to the Celo Community Fund Governance contract*

Here’s the **amendment section** rewritten in clean **Markdown** to match the previous formatting:

---
# Amendment to Original Proposal
Our initail proposal was different from the above proposal. This section is to give context, more can be found on the linked forom post. Following discussions with the Celo Foundation on **priority areas for Season 1** and to ensure the overall ecosystem remains within the **\$3M budget**, we have **revised our scope** and **reduced our budget by 42%** (from **\$811,200 cUSD**).

**Key changes include:**
* **Removal of Pilot Grants:** This category has been removed, as support for Stage 2 teams will now be provided through **Proof of Ship**.
* **Running one round – not two:** This is due to the experimental nature of the Season’s intents and the size of the ecosystem.
* **Discontinuation of Regional DAO Review Support:** This decision is partly budget-driven, but also reflects that grant criteria are now more clear-cut. In previous rounds, the Regional DAO’s role was valuable due to the in-depth local knowledge and subjectivity they brought, which is less necessary under the new framework.
* **Review Support via Celo Foundation:** The Foundation will nominate team members (on a **pro bono basis**) to support reviews as needed.
* **Reduced Management Overheads:** In line with the scope changes, we’ve scaled down management time accordingly (including the removal of July expenses due to the late start of Season 1).

### Introduction of the Boost Pool
We’re introducing a **new funding stream**: the **Boost Pool**.
* Allocates **\$150k cUSD** to **fast-track promising teams**, particularly those already collaborating with the Foundation.
* **Invite-only** by the Celo Foundation, operating over the entire duration of Season 1 until all funding is allocated.
* Teams must still **submit an application**, **complete KYC**, and **receive milestone-based funding**.
* Awards smaller grants between **\$5k–\$10k cUSD**.

## Summary
We have **reduced our Season 1 budget by 42%** to align with the **Celo Foundation’s priorities** and to help ensure the community stays within the **\$3M spending cap**.

Our **core metrics, team, operations, and motivation remain unchanged**. Prezenti is proud to support this next chapter of the Celo ecosystem and excited to play a key role in its evolution.

A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command (on-chain ID determined after submission):
$ celocli governance:show --proposalID XXX --node https://forno.celo.org

Risks
============================
- This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.
- This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

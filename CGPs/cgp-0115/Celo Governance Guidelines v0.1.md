Celo Governance Guidelines
Version: v0.1
Date: January, 2024
This document describes Celo's current governance proposal process. It will evolve over
time based on the needs and desires of Celo. A copy of the authoritative version is
maintained on the Celo Github.
Celo Governance Guidelines v0.1
Description of the proposed Celo Governance System
The CELO Lockers govern Celo through the Governance Guidelines, supported by the
Governance Guardians, and fund developments with resources from the Community Treasury,
stewarded by the Celo Public Goods Stewards, to realize Celo’s vision to build a regenerative
digital economy that creates conditions of prosperity for all.

Current Celo Governance
Governance Toolkit
The governance tools for Celo governance are currently:
- Celo Governance Contract: The on-chain voting contract for Celo governance. This is
also the address of the Celo Community Treasury.
- Celo.Stake.id: A front-end interface for Celo governance maintained by Staking Fund.
- Celo Terminal: A desktop application allowing Celo chain interactions and governance
participation.
- StakedCelo dApp: An application that allows for liquid staking of Celo and voting on
Governance proposals.
- The Celo Forum: The platform for governance and community discussion.
- Discord: For informal governance discussion and feedback.
- Github: Governance guidelines and CGP proposals are tracked via Github.
Tools that are being evaluated or developed and can be included in a future version:
- Celo Snapshot: A locked Celo snapshot strategy is being scoped out to allow votes to
occur on Snapshot. Snapshot would first be used for Celo Public Goods Budget
distribution.
- Celo Station: A complete application for Celo delegation, governance, and bridging that
will integrate the Delegate function added to Celo Governance Contracts.
- Valora Voting UI: A mobile-friendly feature to lock Celo, delegate voting power, and vote
on proposals to be included in the Valora Wallet is currently being scoped.
The Governance Toolkit will evolve with each version of Celo Governance Guidelines to make
governance more resilient and effective.

Proposed Proposal Process
Celo makes decisions through governance proposals. A new proposal must be of the
proposal type listed below and follow the voting process described in this document to be
considered valid. Proposals are accepted or rejected using a voting process.

Voting Process
All governance proposals go through a cycle of at least three weeks.
Feedback and Review Phase
Proposals must be posted in the Celo Forum for review by the Celo community. It is required to
post the proposal as a new discussion thread in the appropriate category and to mark it with
[Discussion] in the title. Proposal authors are expected to be responsive to feedback.
A proposal needs to be up for discussion for at least 7 full days, during which responsiveness
from the author is mandatory.
To proceed to the submission and voting phase, at least two Governance Guardians must post
explicitly that the proposal fulfills the requirements to be able to move into the Voting Stage in
the proposal thread on the Celo Forum. If a Governance Guardian signals readiness for a
proposal to move to a vote, it does not endorse that proposal. It simply signifies that they
verified the proposal is ready to move to a vote and follows the Governance Guidelines.
After a proposal has received the required approvals, the proposal author shall update the
proposal thread title from [Discussion] to [Final]. Authors shall also include a summary of
incorporated feedback as a comment on their proposal thread so future reviewers can
understand the proposal’s progress. If feedback was gathered outside of the Forum (e.g. on
Discord), proposal authors shall include relevant links.
If a proposal author does not get explicit approval or wants more time for feedback, they
should continue to seek feedback from the community and submit an updated proposal.
Proposal Submission and Voting Phase
Once a proposal has been flagged as ready for submission, any account that matches the
Submission Requirements can submit the proposal to Celo Governance following the below
processes.
● Celo Governance Contracts
When a proposal is submitted to the Celo Governance Contracts, it will follow the current
voting process as indicated in the Governance Documentation.

● Celo Public Goods Snapshot
When a proposal is submitted to the Celo Public Goods snapshot space, it will be up
for a single-choice vote for five days. During this period, no changes can be made to
the proposal. If a proposal is accepted, the proposer can request execution by the
Celo Public Goods Multi-sig within 30 days. If no request is made within 30 days, the
proposal will be considered abandoned and the proposal will be voided.
All decisions will be made using token-weighted voting based on the Locked Celo balances
at the moment of Proposal submission. It is recommended, but optional, to submit a
proposal on Wednesday to streamline votes.
Cool-off period for failed proposals
If a proposal is not accepted, a so-called cool-off or rest period for additional conversation
and potential changes is started before the proposal can be resubmitted again.
If a proposal is rejected due to not reaching a quorum but having a majority of yes votes, the
proposal is moved back to the discussion stage and may be submitted for a vote after waiting
for 14 days.
If a proposal is rejected and has a majority of no votes, the proposal is moved back to the
discussion stage and may be submitted for a vote after receiving approval from the
Governance Guardians and waiting for 28 days.

Implementation and Administration
In all cases, Celo Governance is intended to be carried out consistent with the Celo
Governance Guidelines and the pursuit of the Celo Vision.
The Celo Governance Guardians, a group of community-elected individuals, provide
support and oversight to the Celo Governance process. This support includes:
● Ensuring proposals follow the Celo Governance Guidelines.
● Supporting proposers with aligning their proposals to the guidelines.
● Removal and flagging of proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent or
spam-oriented.
● Verifying proposals that are ready to move towards a vote.
● Hosting Celo Governance calls to discuss proposals and Governance process
improvements.
● Monitoring of votes, voting power, the votable token supply, and voting periods to
determine whether quorums and approval thresholds are met or accurately reflected.

Celo Governance Guardians Overview

The initial six Celo Governance Guardians are proposed because they each play a role as Celo
Governance Proposal editor, actively participate in the Governance Process, or have a proven
background in supporting on-chain Governance. In the next six months, the Celo Public Goods
Stewards will create guidelines for electing new Guardians in potential future Governance
Cycles.

Title: Funding Request: Celo Public Goods Budget - H1 2024

Authors: [Luuk Weber](https://forum.celo.org/u/luukdao/summary) & [Monty Bryant](https://forum.celo.org/u/montymerlin/summary)

  

###  Summary

Amidst the ever-evolving Web3 landscape, Celo stands at a pivotal point where identifying and nurturing its public goods is more crucial than ever to sustain growth, development, and adoption. This proposal validates a Celo Public Goods budget for the first half of 2024 (H1) alongside electing the first Public Goods Stewards that will administer these resources efficiently, enhance coordination, and support the growth of the Celo ecosystem.

  

The Stewards will provide critical community-led leadership, governance, communication, operations, and accounting support. This includes leading the operations of programs such as Celo native quadratic and retroactive funding rounds and streamlining funding distribution to Celo public good initiatives such as Celo Regional DAOs, Celo Project Incubation, and Celo Grants through Public Goods project proposals in the to be established Celo Snapshot space. Celo voters will receive voting power equal to their current voting power in Celo Governance and will vote which projects receive funding. For this initiative, we request a budget of up to 1,600,000 cUSD and 700,000 CELO from the Celo Community Treasury to be allocated during the H1 period, as detailed in this proposal.

### Motivation

Supporting Celo Public Goods is essential to realizing [Celo’s vision](https://celo.org/vision) of scaling Ethereum with real-world solutions and fostering prosperity for all. These assets provide non-excludable value to all Celo stakeholders and are integral to building a regenerative economy for Celo and humanity.

  

The current surge in digital public goods innovation, highlighted by [Gitcoin's large-scale](https://2023.gitcoin.co/)  public goods funding and the [Optimism Collective's retrospective funding](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-3/) models (RPGF), underscores the importance of nurturing public goods. It is the key to maintaining a flywheel of ecosystem growth. Yet amidst the ongoing transition to CEL2, current Celo ecosystem funding and governance mechanisms are emerging as constraints to this essential growth and support. Current CELO distribution from the Community Treasury Contract faces complex procedures, on-chain limitations and lacks advanced accounting tools. Other impacts have included governance fatigue for Celo token holders, reduced access to capital for new and existing community ventures on Celo, and a lack of cohesive coordination and accountability.

  

We propose electing the first Celo Public Goods Stewards to address these challenges. Aimed at streamlining coordination and resource allocation, the Stewards will tackle these bottlenecks, guiding critical public good programs through clear leadership, governance, communication, and accounting. For this proposal, we suggest a six-month initial budget period, balancing the uncertainty of CEL2's evolution with the immediate development needs.

  

This initiative is more than a strategic move; it's vital for Celo's progression alongside CEL2, ensuring the community-led ecosystem remains dynamic, innovative, and efficient.

### Operations Logistics

The CPG budget will administer these proposals (listed above) through a 5 out of 9 multisig Safe managed by a diverse set of Celo-aligned stewards. At the same time, all assets within the CPG Multisig will remain under the ownership of the Celo Community Treasury, with Celo Governance retaining the right to request the return of assets to the Celo Community Treasury at any point and a fixed deadline for returning unallocated resources by July 31st, 2024.

  

Beyond the multisig, the specific allocation of the H1 budget will be governed through a Celo Public Goods Snapshot with a single active strategy based on the same locked Celo balances as used in the Celo Governance Contracts, providing community governance with decision-making power weighted according to locked Celo. Resources will be allocated on a first-pass basis up to the category limits as indicated above. Proposers are encouraged to add funding milestones and clear objectives to their proposals.

  

To uphold transparency and foster open dialogue on the advancements and status of each Celo Public Good initiative, the CPGC will create and publish monthly progress reports in the Celo Forum to ensure all activities and progress are communicated effectively.

### Celo Governance Stewards Overview

The initial Celo Governance Stewards are proposed because they each provided input in the Celo Public Goods proposal and played significant roles in the Celo community over the past year. In the next six months, the Celo Public Goods Stewards will create guidelines for electing new Stewards in potential future Public Goods Cycles.

### Action Plan

When this proposal is passed, the following actions will be taken:  
- The Celo Public Goods Multi-sig will be established, and each signor will make a public vouch validating their address and committing to respecting Celo Governance’s jurisdiction.  
- The Celo Public Goods snapshot space and locked Celo voting Strategy will be created.  
- Guidelines are published for Celo Public Goods Proposals

- As soon as the three points above are met, Celo Public Good Proposals can be submitted to the Snapshot space.

- When proposals are passed, they will be funded based on the defined payment terms in their proposal until July 20th, 2024.

  
The Celo Public Goods Stewards will execute all tasks related to the initiatives as indicated in this proposal. Every month, starting in February, the Celo Public Goods Stewards will publish a report covering the state of the Celo Community Treasury and the progress of the Celo Public Goods initiative.

### Risk Considerations  
Below is a breakdown of identified risks and how they are mitigated.

Centralization Risk: By establishing the Celo Public Goods Multisig, some centralization risk is created as a smaller group of individuals have custody over some Celo Community Treasury resources. These risks are reduced by having a diverse set of individuals with major skin in the game involved, providing monthly reports backed by on-chain data, allowing the Celo Community Treasury through Celo Governance to redeem its assets at any point, and committing to return any left-over resources by July 31st latest.

  
Budget Deficit Risk: By adding a spending cap on certain categories, Celo might potentially miss out on funding  valuable initiatives that weren’t proposed in time or exceed the available budget. This risk is reduced by weeks of conversations with the groups who were previously funded by the Celo Community Treasury to have reasonable indications of budget requirements.

## Overview

### Objective

The objective of this proposal is to establish a bug-bounty program on Immunefi and allocate 2,000,000 CELO from community governance funds.

### Immunefi

ImmuneFi is a security platform that provides decentralized bug bounty programs and security assessments for DeFi (decentralized finance) projects and blockchains.

The platform allows DeFi projects to create their own bug bounty programs with customized rules and rewards, and incentivizes security researchers to find and report security vulnerabilities in exchange for rewards in cryptocurrency.

In addition to bug bounty programs, ImmuneFi also offers security assessments and code reviews to help DeFi projects identify and fix vulnerabilities before they become critical security issues. This can help DeFi projects build more secure and trustworthy platforms for users.

For comparison, here is a list of other major blockchains and web3 services currently using Immunefi:

* Wormhole ($10,000,000* US in rewards)
* MakerDAO ($10,000,000* US in rewards)
* Polygon ($2,100,000* US in rewards)
* Optimism ($2,000,000* US in rewards)
* Algorand ($2,000,000* US in rewards)
* Gnosis ($2,000,000* US in rewards)
* Arbitrum ($2,000,000* US in rewards)

Any transaction requires the confirmation of 5 out of 7 signatories.

#### Budget

The CGP is requesting 1 Million CELO from the on-chain governance Community Fund.

??The proposal will also have a quarter and mid point check in after a percentage of the Treasury.

#### Additional Information

The setup can mimic the CCF proposal where the on-chain Community Fund can withdraw those funds if they are left unused after a time by a future governance proposal.
 
#### Compensation

We propose for the equivalent of $100/hr payable in cUSD from the CET’s CELO holdings, within a cap of 40 hrs/week, be paid as compensation for the administrative operations of the CET. The funds for both the program and the administrative pay will be allocated upfront to the CET multisig from the on-chain Celo Community Fund treasury. In line with this proposal’s commitment to the community, all hours and activities of program operations will be logged publicly and transparently.

### First 90 Days Plan of Action

Given the Celo Ecosystem Treasury (CET) is going to focus heavily on funding large scale projects where other community funds and grant programs had a smaller scale, this is the plan for the first 30-90 Days with the activation of the CET.

The CET aims to immediately put the funds to good use funding ecosystem and open-source projects.

In the first 30 Days, the CET will:
* Reach out to 5 projects from the categories listed in the Appendix to begin conversation on support and scoping out funding requirements.

In the first 90 Days, the CET will:
* Fund at least 1 project in each high-level category from those listed in the Appendix.

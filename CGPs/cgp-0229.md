# Overview

This proposal is a proxy governance proposal that mirrors Mento Governance Proposal 15 (MGP-15).
As part of the ongoing coordination between the Celo community and the Mento community, Celo token holders
have the opportunity to vote in Mento Governance with the Celo Community fund Mento Allocation.

MGP-15 proposes an allocation of up to $3.75M from the Mento Protocol Reserve over-collateralization
to the Mento Protocol Foundation. The funds will support future expenses tied to orchestrating
a successful token launch in Q2, ongoing development and operational costs tied to the upcoming
Mento V3 deployment on Celo, Monad, and beyond, as well as external liabilities
and Foundation operational costs.

# Motivation

The Mento ecosystem is at a pivotal point, gearing up for its largest release to date: Mento V3,
which transitions the protocol to an on-chain FX powerhouse. This release also marks Mento's
first cross-chain expansion to the Monad ecosystem. To support these efforts, the Mento Protocol
Foundation requires dedicated funding from the Reserve's overcollateralization.

Key motivations include:

- Funding a successful Mento token launch in Q2.
- Supporting ongoing development and operational costs for the Mento V3 deployment on Celo, Monad, and beyond.
- Covering external liabilities and Foundation operational costs.
- Leveraging non-core reserve assets (outside Tier 0-2 per MGP-10) to fund protocol growth without impacting core collateral.

Please see [the discussion forum post](https://forum.mento.org/t/mgp-15-mento-protocol-foundation-funding-request) for more details on the proposal.

# Risks

- Reserve impact risk: Withdrawing $3.75M from the overcollateralization reduces the reserve buffer, potentially affecting protocol resilience during adverse market conditions.
- Token launch risk: If the token launch does not proceed as planned, allocated funds may not generate the expected return for the protocol.
- Execution risk: The Mento V3 deployment across multiple chains introduces technical complexity that could lead to delays or additional costs.

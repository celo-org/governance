### Proposal Description

This proposal aims to add both native USDC and USDT to the FeeHandler contract. Doing so will allow the correct distribution of tokens, as defined in the [Great Celo Halvening proposal](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-169).
 
## Proposed Changes
 
Fill out the following template for each transaction in the proposal
 
1. Adding USDC to the FeeHandler
  - FeeHandler.addToken
  - Data: address tokenAddress = `0xcebA9300f2b948710d2653dD7B07f33A8B32118C` (USDC), address handlerAddress = `0xD3aeE28548Dbb65DF03981f0dC0713BfCBd10a97`
  - Value: 0
2. Adding USDT to the FeeHandler
  - FeeHandler.addToken
  - Data: address tokenAddress = `0x48065fbBE25f71C9282ddf5e1cD6D6A887483D5e` (USDT), address handlerAddress = `0xD3aeE28548Dbb65DF03981f0dC0713BfCBd10a97`
  - Value: 0

The handlerAddress is the UniswapFeeHandlerSeller (`0xD3aeE28548Dbb65DF03981f0dC0713BfCBd10a97`), as the sells are not enabled this is not relevant, but the FeeHandler requires this address to be non-zero to handle the token properly.

## Risks
 
As the tokens discussed in this proposal are well-known standard token process, there's no obvious risk worth flagging.

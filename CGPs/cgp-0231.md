Proposal Description
============================
This proposal requests $2.7M equivalent to 21,738,286 CELO at 90 day average price of $0.1242 in Season 2 funding to continue operating CICLOPS as Celo's core infrastructure coordination and support function. Following Celo's successful transition to an Ethereum Layer-2 and a full Season 1 of stable operations, Season 2 shifts the focus from transition to sustained operation, upgrades, and scaling. The funding will ensure that critical infrastructure such as wallets, indexers, oracles, explorers, data availability, and monitoring remains reliable, upgrade-ready, and aligned with cLabs' H1 2026 technical roadmap. Funds will be used exclusively to pay infrastructure vendors, with CICLOPS contributors continuing to serve in an unpaid oversight and coordination role, emphasizing reliability, cost efficiency, and operational continuity as the network evolves.

Additionally, this proposal includes a transfer of 43,012,777.340972869827370586 CELO from the Governance Reserve to the Community Fund. The Community Fund currently has insufficient balance to fulfill approved and pending proposals. This transfer will replenish the Community Fund to ensure that existing approved proposals as well as future proposals can execute their approved fund claims.

Verification

A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command (on-chain ID determined after submission):

`$ celocli governance:show --proposalID xxx --node https://forno.celo.org`

Risks
============================
This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represents minimal risk to the network.

The CICLOPS funding component does not transfer funds directly from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

The Reserve-to-Community-Fund transfer (Transaction 1) moves 43,012,777 CELO to replenish the Community Fund for current and future proposals. This is a direct transfer and should be verified carefully.

CELO token value fluctuation could affect execution capacity.

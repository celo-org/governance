## Proposal Description
This proposal requests $1.5M in funding from the Celo community treasury to support essential ecosystem programs stewarded by the Celo Foundation during Season 2 (January–June 2026). The funding is intended to ensure continuity and focused execution across builder and ecosystem growth, strategic partnerships, marketing and communications, ecosystem events, and streamlined regional support during a pivotal scaling year for Celo.

This request is narrowly scoped to sustain the core ecosystem work that directly drives onchain transaction growth and TVL, including continued expansion of the MiniPay and Mini App ecosystem, high-impact distribution and partnership channels, and global ecosystem visibility. The proposal also enables operational continuity while the Tokenomics Initiative proceeds deliberately and transparently in parallel.

The scope and execution of this work are directly aligned with Celo Governance’s Season 2 Intents:

* Grow onchain transactions  
* Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)

## Risks

* This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.  
* This proposal does not transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

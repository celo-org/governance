## Overview
The proposal sets a new standard for Celo Governance operations and Public Goods funding.

There are three sections of this proposal that together aim to accelerate Celo’s vision of creating a regenerative digital economy that creates conditions of prosperity for all.

**Establish the Celo Governance Guidelines v0.1**

This section describes the Celo Governance Guidelines V0.1. The Governance Guidelines separate the Celo Governance Proposals into different categories and standardize the process for the voting, execution, and resubmission of proposals. It also transforms the role of Celo Governance Proposal Editors to a more active role that ensures proposers correctly follow the Celo Governance Guidelines, referred to as the Governance Guardians, and elects the first batch of Guardians. Finally, it raises the deposit for submitting a proposal from 100 to 10,000 CELO.

**Mento reserve: Return a combination of cUSD and CELO**

The section describes the process for utilizing a share of the 95M CELO to be returned to the Community Treasury to mint cUSD to the Celo Community Treasury and return the remaining CELO. The Mento Reserve will mint 10,000,000 cUSD in exchange for the equivalent value of CELO using the 30-day moving average price on January 22nd, 2024, using CoinGecko’s price feeds. The remaining 81,633,000 CELO will be sent to the Celo Community Treasury. This transfer will grant the Celo Community Treasury a significant amount of stablecoins for operations, increase the distribution of cUSD, and increase the stability of CELO, which the Mento reserve also benefits from.

**Fund the Celo Public Goods Budget H1 2024**

The section describes the process of earmarking a budget of up to 1,600,000 cUSD and 700,000 CELO to fund Celo Public Goods in the first half of 2024 (H1) to streamline funding distribution to key Celo Public Goods, such as Celo Regional DAOs, Celo Project Incubation, and Celo Grants, run Celo-native Quadratic Funding (QF) and Retrospective Public Goods Funding (RPGF). It also establishes and elects the first Celo Public Goods Stewards that will administer these resources efficiently, enhance coordination, and support the growth of the Celo ecosystem.

This proposal directly results from the Governance Development Sprint ahead of CEL2, which started in October, and considers the information from the Existing Governance Tools and L2 Governance Framework and Celo Community Proposals and Treasury Allocation from Apr 2020 - Nov 2023. The initial direction was shared in the Forum in November and presented in Kuneco in December. The draft has been up on the forum for community input for about two weeks. Now, all changes have been merged, and the proposal is ready to move towards a vote.

We intend to present the proposal in the Governance Call on January 24th, 2024, and if no significant conflicts arise, submit it to Celo Governance the day after. 

## Proposed Changes
The intent of the CGP is to:
1. transfer 81,633,000 CELO from the Mento Reserve to the Celo Governance contract (Community Fund)
  - 41,633,000 CELO as part of the on-chain component of this CGP
  - 40,000,000 CELO directly from Custody (will be executed by Mento Labs as soon as the proposal passes).
2. Mint 10,000,000 cUSD to the Celo Governance contract
3. Transfer curve LP tokens from the Governance contract to the Mento Reserve
4. Increase the minimum deposit required for CGP submission to 10,000 (from 100)
5. Increase allowances of the Public Goods Stewards Spender multisig on Celo Governance assets

## Risks
- **Mento Reserve Risk:** Returning the CELO and minting an additional 10,000,000 cUSD will decrease the overall Reserve Ratio to approximately 1.90. This means each cStable would still be backed by nearly double the value. As long as the share of Stablecoin collateral equals or is larger than the outstanding amount of cStables, the new Reserve Ratio should not lead to significant additional risks for cStable users.
- **Budget Deficit Risk:** By adding a spending cap on certain categories, Celo might potentially miss out on funding valuable initiatives that weren’t proposed in time or exceed the available budget. This risk is reduced by weeks of conversations with the groups who were previously funded by the Celo Community Treasury to have reasonable indications of budget requirements.
- **Centralization Risk:** By establishing the Celo Public Goods Multisig, some centralization risk is created as a smaller group of individuals have custody over some Celo Community Treasury resources. These risks are reduced by having a diverse set of individuals with major skin in the game involved, providing monthly reports backed by on-chain data, allowing the Celo Community Treasury through Celo Governance to redeem its assets at any point, and committing to return any left-over resources by July 31st latest.

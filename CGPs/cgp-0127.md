## Overview

This proposal seeks to update the `maxDelegateesCount` in the Celo governance framework. By increasing the limit on the number of delegatees, we're aiming to enhance the flexibility of vote delegation. This change is designed to accommodate the varying needs of Celo holders, recognizing that some may prefer to entrust their voting power to multiple delegates who can actively participate in the governance process on their behalf. This adjustment is a step towards optimizing governance participation, ensuring that it can be as effective and inclusive as possible.

## Proposed Changes

 - Data: 10
 - Value: 0 (NA)

## Verification

1. Confirm proposal steps: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID [proposalID] -n https://forno.celo.org `

## Risks

The primary adjustment involves managing a potentially increased number of delegatees, which could introduce complexities in vote management. However, this change is anticipated to align with the community's desire for more dynamic and accessible governance mechanisms.

## Summary

This proposal requests **3,430,000 CELO tokens($276,400 cUSD)** to fund Prezenti's Season 2 operations from February through August 2026. Combined with $70,000 in carryover from Season 1, this provides **$346,400 total capacity** to operate Celo's direct grants program.

Prezenti focuses exclusively on funding builders aligned with ecosystem priorities, emphasizing applications that generate transaction volume and TVL growth, particularly through MiniPay distribution. Season 2 streamlines operations by consolidating to two focused grant pools: Boost (invite-only, Foundation-aligned teams) and Anchor (open applications with stage-based criteria).

This represents a 41% reduction in funding compared to Season 1 while maintaining execution capacity through improved operational efficiency and strengthened stage-based criteria.

## Motivation

Prezenti operates Celo's direct grants program, funding builders aligned with ecosystem priorities. The organization has demonstrated strong execution in Season 1, achieving:

- 17 grants signed
- $130,000 deployed to builders
- $200,000 in strategic partnerships facilitated
- $86,790 rolled forward to Season 2
- Successful "Boost Pool" approach for identifying aligned builders

The grants landscape has matured since Season 1. Prezenti now focuses exclusively on two core intents:

1. **Growing Transactions**: Supporting revenue-generating applications that contribute to chain sustainability
2. **Growing TVL**: Prioritizing teams demonstrating verifiable traction with 10,000+ daily transactions

This focused approach ensures disciplined deployment of ecosystem resources toward measurable outcomes that directly impact Celo's growth.

## Specification

### Grant Pools for Season 2

Prezenti will operate two distinct grant pools:

#### 1. Boost Pool - $70,000 (Carryover)
- **Type**: Invite-only
- **Focus**: Foundation-aligned teams with strategic importance
- **Criteria**: Teams identified through Foundation partnerships and ecosystem priorities
- **Process**: Direct outreach and fast-track evaluation

#### 2. Anchor Pool - $220,000 (New Funding)
- **Type**: Open applications
- **Focus**: Stage-based funding aligned with transaction volume criteria
- **Structure**:
  - **Stage 2** (10K-100K daily transactions): ~$25K grants
  - **Stage 3** (100K-500K daily transactions): ~$50K grants
  - **Stage 4** (500K+ daily transactions): Case-by-case evaluation

### Budget Breakdown

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Grant Capacity** | $290,000 | Direct grants to builders |
| **Steward Compensation** | $51,400 | Team operations (Feb-Aug 2026) |
| **Contingency** | $5,000 | Wind-down reserve |
| **Total Operations** | **$56,400** | 19% overhead ratio |
| **Total Request** | **$346,400** | Full program budget |

### Funding Request Details

- **New cUSD**: $276,400
- **CELO Tokens**: 3,430,000 CELO (based on payment terms below)

**Final Payment Terms:**

The payment will be in CELO due to the Community Fund contract holding the majority of available funds in CELO. We use a 90‑day rolling average to determine the price, which smooths out short‑term volatility and provides a fair valuation for grant disbursement.

Based on this 90‑day average (November 14, 2025 – February 12, 2026), CELO is valued at approximately $0.095 USD, implying that to fully cover the requested $276,400 USD budget, approximately 2,909,000–2,997,000 CELO would be required (including a ~3% buffer for price movement and execution).

However, when testing a real swap on-chain using the cUSD/CELO pool, the executable rate is currently ~12.05 CELO per 1 cUSD (≈$0.083 per CELO). At this rate, approximately 3,329,000 CELO would be needed to realize the full $276,400 budget.

We are therefore requesting 3,430,000 CELO, aligning with the current executable on‑chain rate plus a ~3% buffer for price movement. Presenting both the 90‑day average and the real‑time executable price ensures transparency for governance and guarantees that the program is properly funded regardless of market depth or execution slippage. Any unused funds would be returned to the Community Fund and documented in a similar fashion to our [Season 1 reporting](https://forum.celo.org/t/prezenti-season-1-funding-request-direct-grants-revised/11754/17?u=prezenti.grants).

## Risks

### Governance & Execution Risks
- **Multisig Dependency**: Requires 2/3 signers for all transactions; mitigated by experienced team with proven track record
- **Builder Selection**: Risk of funding projects that don't achieve traction; mitigated by stage-based criteria requiring demonstrated transaction volume
- **Market Volatility**: CELO token value fluctuation could affect grant capacity; mitigated by 3% buffer in token allocation

### Ecosystem Risks
- **Concentration Risk**: Two-pool structure may limit diversity; mitigated by maintaining both invite-only and open application pathways
- **Sustainability**: Builders may become grant-dependent; mitigated by focus on revenue-generating applications with demonstrated traction

### Mitigation Strategies
- Transparent multisig operations with public transaction logs
- Rigorous stage-based criteria requiring verifiable metrics
- Mid-season forum update for community oversight
- DevRel integration for quality pipeline sourcing
- Wind-down commitment ensuring responsible closure if needed

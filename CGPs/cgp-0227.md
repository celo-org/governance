## Summary

This proposal requests **$346,400 USD (in Celo's native token - CELO)** to fund Prezenti's Season 2 operations from February through August 2026. This includes $70,000 in carryover from Season 1, providing **$346,400 total capacity** to operate Celo's direct grants program.

Prezenti focuses exclusively on funding builders aligned with ecosystem priorities, emphasizing applications that generate transaction volume and TVL growth, particularly through MiniPay distribution. Season 2 streamlines operations by consolidating to two focused grant pools: Boost (invite-only, Foundation-aligned teams) and Anchor (open applications with stage-based criteria).

This represents a 41% reduction in funding compared to Season 1 while maintaining execution capacity through improved operational efficiency and strengthened stage-based criteria.

## Motivation

Prezenti operates Celo's direct grants program, funding builders aligned with ecosystem priorities. The organization has demonstrated strong execution in Season 1, achieving:

- 17 grants signed
- $130,000 deployed to builders
- $200,000 in strategic partnerships facilitated
- $86,790 rolled forward to Season 2
- Successful "Boost Pool" approach for identifying aligned builders

The grants landscape has matured since Season 1. Prezenti now focuses exclusively on two core intents:

1. **Growing Transactions**: Supporting revenue-generating applications that contribute to chain sustainability
2. **Growing TVL**: Prioritizing teams demonstrating verifiable traction with 10,000+ daily transactions

This focused approach ensures disciplined deployment of ecosystem resources toward measurable outcomes that directly impact Celo's growth.

## Specification

### Grant Pools for Season 2

Prezenti will operate two distinct grant pools:

#### 1. Boost Pool - $70,000 (Carryover)
- **Type**: Invite-only
- **Focus**: Foundation-aligned teams with strategic importance
- **Criteria**: Teams identified through Foundation partnerships and ecosystem priorities
- **Process**: Direct outreach and fast-track evaluation

#### 2. Anchor Pool - $220,000 (New Funding)
- **Type**: Open applications
- **Focus**: Stage-based funding aligned with transaction volume criteria
- **Structure**:
  - **Stage 2** (10K-100K daily transactions): ~$25K grants
  - **Stage 3** (100K-500K daily transactions): ~$50K grants
  - **Stage 4** (500K+ daily transactions): Case-by-case evaluation

### Budget Breakdown

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Grant Capacity** | $290,000 | Direct grants to builders |
| **Steward Compensation** | $51,400 | Team operations (Feb-Aug 2026) |
| **Contingency** | $5,000 | Wind-down reserve |
| **Total Operations** | **$56,400** | 19% overhead ratio |
| **Total Request** | **$346,400** | Full program budget |

### Funding Request Details

**The payment will be in CELO** due to the community fund contract holding the majority of available funds in CELO. **We use a 90-day rolling average** to determine the price, which smooths out short-term volatility and provides a fair valuation for grant disbursement.

- **Total Budget**: $346,400 USD
- **New Funding Requested**: $276,400 USD (in CELO)
- **Carryover from Season 1**: $70,000 USD
- **CELO Amount**: 2,520,000 CELO (based on 90-day rolling average plus 3% buffer)

### Timeline

- **January 2026**: Proposal ratification
- **February 2026**: Boost pool activation; Anchor applications open
- **May 2026**: Mid-season forum update
- **June 2026**: Application deadline
- **June/July 2026**: Season close and planning

### Key Performance Indicators

Prezenti commits to delivering:

- 12-18 grants signed
- Two complete grant rounds delivered
- 100% rejected applicant feedback provided
- Mid-season update published
- At least one grantee case study released
- Public multisig transaction logs maintained

### Team & Governance

**Multisig Signers (2/3 required):**
- **Wade Abel** — Founder, independent validator, Governance Guild member

- **Aaron Boyd** — Founder (advisory role), independent validator

**Multisig Address**: 0xA5c9389A0Ce1bFe24FF883E761Ff313225C77D44

### Key Improvements from Season 1

2. **Consolidated Approach**: Two pools instead of three for operational efficiency
3. **Strengthened Criteria**: Enhanced stage-based alignment with transaction volume
4. **Reduced Overhead**: 41% lower total ask while maintaining capacity
5. **Maintained DevRel Integration**: Continued pipeline sourcing through ecosystem partners

### Wind-Down Commitment

- Completing all existing grant obligations
- Responsibly closing operations
- Returning unspent funds to the Community Treasury
- Providing final accounting and documentation

Risks
============================
- This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.
- This proposal does not transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

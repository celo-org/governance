## Overview 
 
The Celo SHIELD program plans to subsidize audit and security costs for projects building on top of Celo, to protect Celo users and the whole Celo ecosystem at large from bugs and vulnerabilities.

This proposal was planned to ask for the 2nd half of the funds, the 225000 cUSD, as outlinted in the Payment section.

### Status 
- FINAL 

### Proposal Description

NOTE: This is not a new S1 proposal and not part of the 3M ecosystem cap. This is just the proposal to execute the claim on a proposal that has passed in Dec 2024.

This initiative aims to subsidize the cost of security services for projects building on top of Celo. This will involve collaboration with leading security vendors to provide on-chain monitoring, automated security testing, brand protection, security architecture reviews, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and software supply chain security. We aim to leverage industry-leading practices and provide tools that empower projects to adopt and improve their security postures, reducing the risk of exploits that could impact the broader ecosystem.

Funding Request: 450,000 cUSD over two governance proposals, pending milestone completion

All unused funds will be returned to the community fund. 
 
## Background
 
Every security incident in our ecosystem directly impacts CELO token value, degrades users’ trust, makes mainstream adoption more difficult, and gives ammunition to crypto skeptics. These impacts ripple through every project building on Celo.

Traditional security reviews often exceed $150,000 per project, forcing most teams building on Celo to choose between proper security and core development. This is not just about individual projects, it’s about protecting Celo’s entire ecosystem value.

This initiative transforms security from a luxury into a standard feature of building on Celo and aims to:

- Make enterprise-grade security services accessible to Celo ecosystem projects
- Reduce the financial barrier to implementing robust security measures
- Protect user funds and maintain ecosystem trust
- Enable projects to focus resources on development while maintaining security

## Milestones & Verification
 
Phase 1: Program Setup (Q1 2025)
   - Program infrastructure setup
   - Security vendor onboarding
   - Application process launch
   - Community awareness campaign

Phase 2: Initial Partner Enrollment (Q1-Q2 2025)
   - First batch of project applications
   - Initial security assessments
   - Service implementation begins
   - First monthly report publication

Phase 3: Full Program Operation (Q2-Q4 2025)
   - Continuation of project onboarding
   - Service delivery and monitoring
   - Monthly reporting and community updates
   - Mid-program assessment and adjustments

Phase 4: Evaluation and Planning (Q4 2025)
   - Program impact assessment
   - Community feedback collection
   - Sustainability planning
   - Renewal proposal preparation

Key Performance Indicators:
   - Number of Partners Onboarded: Successfully onboard at least 10 ecosystem projects within the first three months.
   - Reduction in Vulnerabilities: Reduction in the number of vulnerabilities identified by scanning tools by 30% by the end of the project.
   - Competitive Bug Bounty Participation: At least 20 bug bounty submissions, with 5 critical vulnerabilities addressed.
   - Customer Satisfaction: Gather feedback from projects; aim for an average satisfaction score of 7/10 or higher.
   - Security Maturity: Increase in overall security maturity scores from a scale of 1 to 5 for at least 70% of the participating projects, with a target of moving projects from an average score of 2 to an average score of 4 by the end of the program.

      "contract": "StableToken",
      "address": "0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a",

## Verification
A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command (on-chain ID determined after submission):

`$ celocli governance:show --proposalID TBD --node https://forno.celo.org`


## Risks
 
Security controls may not improve security posture at maximum efficiency.

This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters so represent minimal risk to the network.

This proposal does transfer funds from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.

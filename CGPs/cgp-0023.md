## Overview

This governance proposal enables oracle addresses to make them able to report the value of CELO/EUR for the cEUR contract, deployed on [CR3](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0022.md). It also proposes to send 100 CELO to each of the oracles to cover gas fees for the first couple of years and freezing StableTokenEUR (cEUR) and ExchangeEUR.

Following [CR3](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0022.md), cEUR will be in a status where it will be imposible to mint or burn due to empty buckets that are not possible to update (because Mento buckets are zero and there are no oracles enabled to update them), but cEUR will be transferable. Freezing is meant to prevent cEUR being transferred before enabling the stability mechanism.

cEUR in circulation with no stability mechanism in place can lead to a de-peg. Although the risk of cEUR moving before its full activation it's very low, this proposal will add an extra layer of security. The only two addresses holding cEUR after CR3 is deployed will be the [Community Fund](https://celocommunityfund.org/) (Governance Proxy) and a Celo Foundation wallet.

Please note this proposal shall be submited after CR3 is proposed, because it needs an address for StableTokenEUR, but it can be executed before or after.
 
[CGP #26](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0022.md) was merged into this proposal after Baklava deployment.


## Proposed Changes

1. The first ten transactions enable a specific address of ten different oracles to report to StableTokenEUR
  - Destination: SortedOracles.addOracle
  - Data: first argument is the StableTokenEUR address (`0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73`) and the second one the address of the oracle to be added (`0xeF1E143C554EFC43B0537Af00Ac27C828dE6cF8D`, `0xF4B4AA107F30206EA019DE145A9b778a220f9fc0`, `0x24c303e6395DD19806F739619960A311764e3F40`, `0xDA413875FB45E5905950Bc08a908ebD246Ee6581`, `0x87C45738DAd8Dc3D2b1cCe779E0766329cc408C6`, `0xb8bDBfdd591a5be5980983A7ba1710a5F46f42B5`, `0x929Ad7f2b781CE830014E824CA2eF0b7b8de87C2`, `0xCCC0B54edD8dAe3c15b5C002dd5d348495d4f7fe`, `0xC5280DDbDEC37540436935C01C912869B2d5Ae1c` and `0xBD955F84e11EE53095F9068b88C9d2Ffd3Def707`).
  - Value: 0
2. The following ten transactions are to fund the oracles addresses mentioned in (1):
  - Destination: GoldToken.transfer
  - Data: first argument is the oracle address (same ones as in (1)) and the second one 100e18 (100 CELO).
  - Value: 0 (it's actually `0` as this was implemented as a token transfer)
3. Freezing StableTokenEUR
  - Destination: Freezer.freeze
  - Data: StableTokenEUR (`0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73`)
  - Value: 0
4. Freezing ExchangeEUR
  - Destination: Freezer.freeze
  - Data: ExchangeEUR (`0xE383394B913d7302c49F794C7d3243c429d53D1d`)
  - Value: in0
## Verification

With the following cli command
`$ celocli governance:view --proposalID 22`

## Risks

- Adding new oracles will add load to the network, which is not a problem at this stage but could become one as new stable assets and other projects deploy new oracles and network adoption grows.
- Oracle rate risk: In case of imprecise CELO/EUR oracle rates and/or manipulated CELO/EUR market rates, users could exchange cEUR or CELO with the reserve at a price that does not reflect the current market valuation. This could negatively affect the reserve collateralization ratio and therefore long-term cEUR stability in two ways: First, a user could mint X cEUR while providing less than X EUR worth of reserve collateral and second, a user could redeem Y cEUR for more than Y EUR worth of reserve collateral. The major mitigant of this risk is the initial reduction of the reserveFraction parameter as explained in the overview section which comes at the cost of the risks described further below. Additional mitigants include oracle client features like a circuit breaker protecting against unreasonably large price movements. (Same as [CGP #0007](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0007.md))

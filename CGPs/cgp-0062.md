## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 8. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v8.pre-audit). Hacken and Verilog have completed an audit of release 8, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v8.pre-audit) for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)

- `Escrow`: `1.1.1.2` => `1.2.0.0`
- `FederatedAttestations`: `0.0.0.0` => `1.1.0.0`
- `UsingRegistryV2`: `1.0.0.0` => `1.1.1.0`
- `UsingRegistryV2BackwardsCompatible`: `0.0.0.0` => `1.1.0.0`
- `OdisPayments`:  `0.0.0.0` => `1.1.0.0`

## Verification

- [ ] TODO (@m-chrzan or @alecps): Update commands with correct `.json` file names (**illustrative `.json` files below for example**)

Fetch onchain proposal:

```bash
celocli governance:show --proposalID <TBD> --jsonTransactions release-7-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

Verify proposal points to deployment which matches audited release:

```bash
cd monorepo/packages/protocol
yarn verify-release -p release-7-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v7 -n mainnet -f
```

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

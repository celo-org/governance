## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 8. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v8). Hacken and Verilog have completed an audit of release 8, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v8.pre-audit) for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)

- `Escrow`: `1.1.1.2` => `1.2.0.0`
- `FederatedAttestations`: `New` => `1.1.0.0`
- `UsingRegistryV2BackwardsCompatible`: `New` => `1.1.0.0`
- `OdisPayments`:  `New` => `1.1.0.0`

## Verification

First make sure to download latest [celo-monorepo]([url](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/)) with

`git clone git@github.com:celo-org/celo-monorepo.git`

or to pull latest if downloaded previously:

`git pull`

then build it with:

`yarn && yarn build`

Once built, cd to the protocol folder with 

`cd packages/protocol`

From there you can download the current proposal:

```bash
../cli/bin/run governance:show --proposalID 71 --jsonTransactions release-8-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Alternatively you can use the CLI distrubuted via npm, but make sure to have version 1.7.0 or higher (with `npm -g install @celo/celocli@1.7.0`). The command above will start with `celocli` instead of `../cli/bin/run` then.


And then verify that the proposal deployment matches audited release:

```
yarn verify-release -p release-8-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v8 -n mainnet -f -i "releaseData/initializationData/release8.json"
```

The output should verify that the bycodes and storages match what is expected.

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

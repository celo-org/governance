## Overview

This proposal is a proxy governance proposal that mirrors Mento Governance Proposal 13 (MGP-13). As part of the ongoing coordination between the Celo community and the Mento community, Celo token holders have the opportunity to vote in Mento Governance with the Celo Community fund Mento Allocation. The on-chain MGP-13 proposal can be found in [governance.mento.org](https://governance.mento.org/proposals/33774473826582746102247872468112299588808192529529153992548885265611575112929).

### Summary

MGP-13 enables a 5bps (0.05%) spread fee and increases the ValueDeltaBreaker circuit breaker thresholds from 10bps to 15bps (0.10% → 0.15%) for the following pairs:

1. `USDm/USDC`
2. `USDm/axlUSDC`
3. `USDm/USD₮`

The goals are to reduce breaker-induced downtime, improve protection against arbitrage losses, and enable protocol revenue on high-volume pairs.

This proposal updates two parameter sets for the above-mentioned USDm pairs:

- **Spread fee**: **0.00% → 0.05%** (0bps → 5bps)
- **Circuit breaker threshold**: **0.10% → 0.15%** (10bps → 15bps)

The increased circuit breaker values are proposed because the current 10bps breakers have started to cause significant downtime (notably for the USD₮ pair) due to recent USD₮ price instability.

The increased spreads are proposed because the current 0% spreads expose the reserve to potential arbitrage losses while related swaps are not generating protocol revenue. It is expected that this leads to reduced swap volume on Mento but an overall increase in protocol revenue and better protection against arbitrage losses for the Mento Reserve.

The current BiPoolManager implementation does not allow updating a pool's spread directly; it requires fully destroying and re-creating the exchange. To simplify this proposal, a temporary BiPoolManager implementation has been deployed that exposes a `setSpread(exchangeId, newSpread)` setter. This temporary implementation is used only to update the spreads; the BiPoolManager is then reverted to its original implementation as part of this proposal.

The temporary implementation has been deployed and verified at: [0xC016174B60519Bdc24433d4ed2cFf6c1efaC7881](https://celoscan.io/address/0xC016174B60519Bdc24433d4ed2cFf6c1efaC7881)

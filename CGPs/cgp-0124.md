## Motivation: The Unparalleled Opportunity Road to Devcon for Celo in Thailand

### Introduction
Firstly, we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Florian Hugenberg [@Frerehugi](https://forum.celo.org/u/frerehugi), the creative mind who proposed and recommended the name KohCelo to us, which we strongly agree with this recommended. Florian, hailing from Germany and a long-standing member of the Celonian community within Celo, shared with us that the term “Koh” is universally recognized and easily remembered by people around the world when thinking of Thailand, citing examples like Koh Phangan, Koh Samui, Koh Phi Phi, Koh Tao, and Koh Chang, among others. So, let’s dive into what this name means and what it represents. KohCelo is a unique and memorable name that perfectly marries the innovative spirit of Celo with the quintessential Thai element of an island. “Koh,” meaning “island” in Thai, conjures images of Thailand’s beautiful, peaceful island landscapes, known for their breathtaking natural beauty and tranquil vibes. This name not only reflects our goal of building an inclusive and sustainable financial ecosystem but also highlights the serene beauty of Thai islands. It symbolizes a perfect harmony of technology and nature, creating a space of connectivity and peace within the Celo network.

According to Chainanalysis, Thailand is among the top 10 countries leading in the Global Crypto Adoption Index 2023. As well as Devcon announcement, Devcon 7 will take place from November 12-15 in the vibrant city of Bangkok, Thailand, with a spirit that will resonate across Southeast Asia over the coming year. The Devcon website mentions that “Southeast Asia is a melting pot of diverse cultures, rich histories, and communities. While Bangkok, Thailand, with its unique blend of tradition and modernity, serves as an ideal location to host Devcon in terms of both venue suitability and global accessibility, our intention is to bring the Devcon experience to the whole of Southeast Asia!” Similarly, the goal of Koh Celo is to establish a significant Celo presence at Devcon 2024, position Thailand as the CELO hub in Southeast Asia (SEA), enhance Celo’s visibility across Thailand & SEA, and strengthen ties within the Crypto Community.

### Crypto Landscape in Thailand
In 2024, Thailand has made significant strides in the crypto and blockchain sectors, marked by progressive regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and strategic industry developments. The SEC’s new guidelines have enhanced the crypto landscape by removing investment limits for retail investors in asset-backed digital tokens and instituting strict custodial wallet management. Furthermore, the introduction of Gulf Binance, a collaborative exchange by Binance and Gulf Energy (Gulf Energy is the No.7 largest company in Thailand with a market cap of $14.17 Billion Dollars, accessed: 3/7/2024), underlines Thailand’s commitment to becoming a key player in the digital asset space. Additionally, Thailand’s Web3 economy is booming, with over 3 million crypto users and a 600% growth in recent years, supported by a crypto-friendly regulatory environment. This growth mirrors the country’s aim to foster innovation and secure its position as a hub for crypto and blockchain in Southeast Asia.

### Celo’s Opportunity to Thailand
Celo has a unique opportunity at Thailand Devcon 2024, given the country’s high mobile internet usage and digital engagement. According to Datareportal (2023), with 85.3% of the Thai population having internet access, Celo’s mobile-first approach aligns well with Thailand’s tech landscape. According to Statista Research Department, as of January 15, 2024, Tether took the highest market share of Thailand’s most traded cryptocurrencies, accounting for around 40.3 percent of the entire market. The nation’s strong digital economy and active online community are ideal for promoting Celo’s blockchain solutions. Celo can enhance its visibility and adoption within the Thai cryptocurrency and tech communities by focusing on educational initiatives and partnerships that leverage Thailand’s digital infrastructure. This strategic engagement can help Celo capitalize on Thailand’s growing interest in blockchain technology, contributing to the region’s broader digital economy and blockchain ecosystem.

### Objectives for Koh Celo Thailand

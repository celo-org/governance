**5\. Summary:**

This proposal seeks to allocate funding of 39,300 cUSD to the Celo Thailand DAO, covering the period from March 1st, 2024, to July 30th, 2024. The goal is to broaden awareness of Celo throughout Thailand and to deepen connections among the Crypto Community. It aims to enhance understanding and raise awareness about the significance of Web3 in Thailand. During the first half of the year, we plan to focus on three key initiatives: 1. Localizing Content to cater to regional preferences, 2. Expanding our Community and engaging with universities, and 3. Enhancing Public Relations and Educational Content. Additionally, we will explore Partnerships and Product development.

6.2 Celo’s Opportunity:

Celo faces an opportunity in Thailand as it is not widely recognized among crypto enthusiasts despite its presence.

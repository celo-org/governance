# Abstract

After achieving the key goals of our initial governance proposal [(CGP-52)](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/60) through Climate Collective’s grants program established in 2022, we request follow-on funding from the Celo community in order to catalyze the growth of Celo’s climate ecosystem in 2023 and 2024.

## Background
Climate Collective (CC) recently published a [“Year 1 Update & Preview of Upcoming CGPs”](https://forum.celo.org/t/climate-collective-1-year-anniversary-heres-to-many-more/5585) forum post that contextualizes this proposal, and is advisable to review before proceeding. More than 44 individuals representing over 30 organizations in the Celo community responded with resoundingly positive validation, including testimonials on our past work and useful suggestions for this next phase of CC’s growth. Key outcomes from our initial proposal are detailed in the Appendix section.

This proposal details CC’s request for 5MM cUSD-denominated funding (up to 10MM CELO) that will enable expansion of its grants program and active contributors, and elevate its thought-leadership work and strategic partnerships. 

# Areas of Focus

CC proposes to utilize funds in line with our 3 strategic objectives, covered in detail in the previously referenced forum post. 

1. [**2.75MM cUSD**] Adoption and deployment of blockchain across the climate sector through a Climate Innovation Grant Fund focused on:
* Blockchain enabled climate tech stack, including 
  * dMRV systems that streamline data collection, processing, and certification for Digital Environmental Assets (DEAs) 
  * Direct payments for ecosystem services (climate-focused UBI)
  * Forward contract structures that are tradeable on-chain
  * Other parts of the core climate finance tech stack (zero knowledge proofs, carbon accounting services, ESG focused smart contact solutions, etc)
* Pilot projects with traditional climate stakeholders (onboard web2 climate leaders to web3), including WWF, IADB, CIFAR alliance, Carbon Business Council, Web3forGood, World Bank (CADT)
* Entrepreneur (EIR) and Scientist in Residence (SIR) programs
2. [**1.5MM cUSD**] ReFi Market Maturity and Commercialization
* Drive adoption of industry frameworks, for example Quality Assessment and Interoperable Data frameworks developed by CC and Rocky Mountain Institute
* Establish research vertical focused on market opportunities that would benefit from brand-recognized academic partnerships to speed up ‘go-to-market’; expand climate data and policy R&D verticals 
* Subsidize security audits from Quantstamp and audit partners, facilitate of protocol insurance from Chainproof and other partners
* Expand support for growth-stage partners and grantees, for example, partner with select accelerators to support success of projects who have successfully completed CC grants
3. [**0.75MM cUSD**] Thought Leadership through Strategic Partnership Initiatives
* Elevate credibility and visibility of successful examples of blockchain based climate solutions, for example through partnerships with academic research organizations (e.g Brookings, RMI, universities, etc), leading consulting firms (e.g. McKinsey, CarbonDirect, KPMG, etc), and banks to generate co-branded comms and content
* Elevate the catalytic role of Climate Collective and the wider ReFi ecosystem through targeted marketing, convening, and industry research, including a series of in-person digital environmental asset summits, industry reports, and other products, periodically bringing together web2 + web3 + corporate sustainability leaders around a shared narrative

Through the success of our initial proposal, certain areas are sufficiently addressed and thus have been deprioritized. For instance, Celo is now home to tokenized carbon assets from Toucan, FlowCarbon, Thallo, and several other projects; accordingly we will not prioritize funding of similar carbon tokenization protocols that may be redundant. 

As discussed in our forum post, CC will arrive at a sustainable financing model before the end of the two year window supported by this proposal. 

## Known Risks
Informed by our last year of operations, we have identified the following risks:

* Market risk: adverse events in crypto markets can severely reduce the value of funds available. This is mitigated by denominating the budget request in cUSD, and using a conservative price to account for CELO.
* Competitive risk: certain other blockchain foundations are offering higher value grants. This is mitigated by CC’s past work in establishing a critical mass of leading climate projects on Celo.

# Implementation

## cUSD Denominated Budget
For this new phase of Climate Collective, we ask to increase our spend permit on the community fund by 10MM CELO, for a total of 11.9MM CELO to be utilized over two years - <ins>**_but hope to not use the full amount_**</ins>. This number accounts for CELO at $0.42 and protects our budget from acute market volatility. Over 2 years, CC would make quarterly withdrawals of CELO equivalent to 625,000 cUSD based on the spot market price, and transact OTC with the help of Mento to convert this to cUSD (as opposed to selling large chunks of CELO on open markets). Any unutilized CELO will remain in the community fund.

## Outcomes from Initial Proposal

Since the first draft of our initial proposal just over a year ago on March 22, 2022, the landscape for ReFi, and more broadly, web3 x climate, has evolved exponentially. Climate Collective has been a driver of a lot of this progress - we have established Climate Collective as an institutionally-credible, market-leading entity and have built a holistic, interconnected climate ecosystem on Celo.

Snapshot of interoperable Climate Collective ecosystem:
* Supply: FlowCarbon, Toucan, Thallo, CarbonPath, Sequestr, Sanergy, Plastiks, Kolor
* Markets: Senken, Atem, Sequestr, Celo DEXs, Unergy
* Demand: Spirals, CarbonTitle, Avatree, Wildchain, Cyberbox
* dMRV & Climate Intelligence: SimplexDNA, MRV Collective, GainForest, Silvi, Athena; OpenEarth, dClimate, Hyphen

The bullets below highlight how we have achieved key goals from our initial proposal:
* Achieved our initial goal of building a diverse, interoperable climate ecosystem that positions Celo at the forefront of ReFi
* Supported a number of innovative climate applications including plastic credits, forward financing, digital land ownership, regenerative community currencies, and DNA sampling-based biodiversity credits on-chain (examples include: Plastiks, Senken, SolidWorld, Sequestr, Kolor, Sanergy, SimplexDNA)
* Experiment with Internet of Things (IoT) sensor integrations and other environmental monitoring, reporting, verification (MRV) applications (examples include: SimplexDNA, MRV Collective, Athena Protocol; and more recently onboarded Hyphen and dClimate into the Climate Collective)
* Collaboratively define qualitative and quantitative assessment framework standards for Mento reserve assets in partnership with Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), one of the most well-respected institutions in climate broadly and carbon specifically, which will enable comparison of carbon credits from disparate standards, including “Big 4” registries, regional/jurisdictional registries, and web3-native “self-certified” credits. This framework, expected to be ready for public use in July ‘23, will guide Celo’s carbon offset purchases (see [CGP-0077](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/103)), as well as Mento’s natural capital onboarding at a later stage.

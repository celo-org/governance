## Overview

This proposal requests $22,000 (183,333 CELO) to settle outstanding bug bounty rewards, concluding the administrative phase of the Celo SHIELD program.

### Status

- DRAFT

### Proposal Description

The Celo SHIELD (Subsidized Help for Improving Ecosystem-Level Defense) program successfully provided security services to projects building on Celo throughout 2025. As part of the program's competitive bug bounty component, security researchers identified and reported vulnerabilities that improved the security posture of the ecosystem.

This proposal represents the final administrative action for the Celo SHIELD program—settling outstanding payments owed to security researchers who contributed valid vulnerability reports during the program's operation.

## Background

The original Celo SHIELD program was funded through CGP-157 (225,000 cUSD) with the goal of subsidizing audit and security costs for projects building on Celo. The program included a competitive bug bounty component with a budget of 60,000 cUSD allocated specifically for rewarding security researchers who identify vulnerabilities.

Bug bounty programs are critical for:
- Incentivizing responsible vulnerability disclosure
- Identifying security issues before malicious actors can exploit them
- Building trust with the security research community
- Maintaining Celo's reputation as a secure platform

Honoring commitments to security researchers is essential for maintaining Celo's credibility and encouraging future responsible disclosures to the ecosystem.

## Budget

| Category | Amount (USD) | Amount (CELO) |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Bug Bounty Rewards | $22,000 | 183,333 |
| **Total** | **$22,000** | **183,333** |

*Note: CELO amount calculated at $0.12/CELO rate*

## Fund Management

Funds will be managed through the existing Celo SHIELD 2/3 multisig wallet:

**Multisig Address:** `0x35ff861a0b6215CeC71EA282B0D32AfefA661795`

**Signers:**

| Nikolaos Frestis | @gloec | 0x2835cd3C9e5aD93C10eBFAcEc943fE1006B1F57a |
| Stefan Ioja | @si-csec | 0x32Af2978880CD100d6Afa1104e8d01554bFe5bD4 |

## Proposed Changes

### Transactions

## Verification

A human readable version of this proposal can be found using the following command (on-chain ID determined after submission):

```
$ celocli governance:show --proposalID TBD --node https://forno.celo.org
```

## Risks

- This proposal does not deploy or upgrade contracts or change network parameters, so it represents minimal risk to the network.
- This proposal does not transfer funds directly from the Community Fund, but rather seeks an approval to pull funds from the fund, which means that the funds will not be lost if the approval address has a typo.
- The multisig wallet and signers are the same trusted parties from the original Celo SHIELD program (CGP-157).

## Overview

This governance proposal will whitelist the Chainlink relayer contracts required to support two new Mento stablecoins: JPY and NGN. This proposal follows [CGP 177 (Adding oracles to support GBP, AUD, CAD, CHF, ZAR stablecoins)](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-177) and [CGP 178 (Launch of the cGBP, cAUD, cZAR & cCAD Stablecoins)](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-178), as the Chainlink feeds for JPY and NGN were not available at the time of those proposals. The ChainlinkRelayer will transmit rate feed data from a Chainlink price feed or an aggregation of multiple Chainlink price feeds to the SortedOracles contract.

The following proxy contracts have been deployed to mainnet and verified, and their ownership has been transferred to governance:

- StableTokenJPYProxy: [0xc45eCF20f3CD864B32D9794d6f76814aE8892e20](https://celoscan.io/address/0xc45eCF20f3CD864B32D9794d6f76814aE8892e20)
- StableTokenNGNProxy: [0xE2702Bd97ee33c88c8f6f92DA3B733608aa76F71](https://celoscan.io/address/0xE2702Bd97ee33c88c8f6f92DA3B733608aa76F71)

Each stablecoin requires two rate feeds - one for the CELO/XXX pair and another for the XXX/USD pair. Details of the rate feeds and corresponding relayer contracts are provided in the table below:

| RateFeed        | RateFeedId                                 | Relayer Contract                                                                                                     |

## Verification

## Risks

The data relayed by the ChainlinkRelayer contract is only as secure as the Chainlink price feeds it relies on. If the Chainlink price feeds are compromised, the data relayed by the ChainlinkRelayer contract could be manipulated. This could lead to the SortedOracles contract reporting incorrect rate feeds to the rest of the protocol.

This risk is present with all Oracle solutions and is not specific to the Chainlink price feeds. In order to mitigate this risk, the Mento Protocol has implemented onchain circuit breakers that automatically pause the protocol if the reported data is outside of a predefined threshold. As well as our onchain trading limits, which limit the trading bandwidth.

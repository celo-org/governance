### **Summary**

This proposal requests the transfer of 9,318,755 CELO from the Governance Reserve (the custody contract created under CGP-156) to the Celo Governance Proxy, making these funds accessible for future governance use.

### **Motivation**

The transfer is intended to ensure that the Celo community can continue executing governance-approved programs and commitments from Season 1. This proposal does **not** seek to spend or allocate any new funds, it is an operational step to make the funds available for withdrawal by previously approved proposals.

### **Specification**

* Source: Governance Reserve (custody reserve established in [CGP-156](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-156))

* Destination: Celo Governance Proxy

* Amount: 9,318,755 CELO

* Purpose: Operational transfer to ensure governance has accessible funds for pre-approved proposal.

The amount requested will cover the current outstanding commitments for proposals that have passed and been executed. The history of proposals can be viewed on [Celo Mondo.](https://mondo.celo.org/governance?tab=History)

### **Next Steps**

* Execute a single on-chain transaction transferring 9,318,755 CELO from the Governance Reserve to the Governance Proxy.

## Overview

The purpose of this proposal is to patch a bug that was identified during the initial mainnet testing of MU01. The bug is related to token precision handling in the BiPoolManager, caused by integrating tokens like USDC with 6 decimals, compared to cUSD's 18 decimals. The fix ensures internal buckets use a consistent 18 decimal precision by introducing precision multipliers for all tokens. This guarantees accurate vAMM bucket size management, regardless of a token's decimal count.

Implementing the fix involves a non-breaking change to the storage structure through the addition of a global mapping for token precision multipliers. The enhancement improves the Mento protocol's reliability and accommodates tokens with different decimals.

## Proposed Changes

1. Set the implementation of the BiPoolManagerProxy to the newly deployed version

   - Destination: [`BiPoolManagerProxy`](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/address/0x22d9db95E6Ae61c104A7B6F6C78D7993B94ec901)
   - Data: `_setImplementation(implementation=0x9f6dac2D571d8f727D762c82af240A170C42193A)`
   - Value: 0

2. Set the token precision multipliers for stable assets and all collateral assets
   - Destination: [`BiPoolManagerProxy`](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/address/0x22d9db95E6Ae61c104A7B6F6C78D7993B94ec901)
   - Data: `setTokenPrecisionMultipliers(
tokens=
[
   0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a,

## Verification

How to verify addresses

- The addresses of proxy contracts can be verified by checking the [deployment addresses](https://docs.mento.org/mento/developers/deployments/addresses) section in the docs.
- The address of the new BiPoolManager implementation can be verified by checking the [broadcast json file](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-deployment/blob/92f7129282a4661acf9f2589c41e2a952db45bd5/broadcast/MU01-04-Deploy-BiPoolMananager.sol/42220/run-latest.json#L7), generated from the deployment script in the deployment repo.
- The address of axlUSDC can be verified by checking the [Axelar documentation](https://docs.axelar.dev/resources/mainnet)
- The address of CELO can be verified by querying the celo registry

TX#1

- Verify that the BiPoolManagerProxy address is correct.
- Verify that the implementation address is correct.

TX#2

- Verify that the BiPoolManagerProxy address is correct
- Verify the addresses in the array of tokens are the correct addresses for the tokens(cUSD, cEUR, cBRL, CELO, axlUSDC)
- Verify that the multipliers are set to the correct values with indices that match the token indices in the tokens array

## Risks

The introduction of new global storage mapping for token precision multipliers and changes to the BiPoolManager's token handling may introduce security risks, including potential smart contract exploits. Rigorous testing, including code audits and simulation testing have been conducted to reduce the likelyhood of such risks.

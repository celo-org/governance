## Overview

This proposal requests funds from the Community Fund to pay Oracle providers (T-Systems and RedStone) for running oracle services on the Celo network for the year 2024, similar to how it was done a year ago in [CGP 67](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/77). T-Systems has been running oracles for the past year and RedStone has recently been added as a new provider in [CGP 102](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/145).

4 ReleaseGold contracts have been deployed for T-systems and Redstone. Two contracts are to cover the month-to-month payments for the full year of service for each provider, and the other two to cover one off payments. The price of Celo was set at the time of deployment, at $0.758.
The payment terms of each contract are as follows:

- T-Systems

  - One-time payment contract of $5311.33 USD / 7007 CELO, as a retroactive compensation for their service in 2023
    - $2211.33 USD - to cover differences from initial payment plan due to CELO/USD price fluctuations
    - $600.00 USD - for deploying 2 additional oracles beyond the scope of the initial agreement
    - $2500.00 USD - for running more than 5 oracles since August 2023
  - Monthly vesting payment contract of $24000 USD / 31668 CELO
    - $2000 USD / 2639 CELO per month for 12 months, according to Tier 2 pricing in the original payment contract.

- RedStone
  - One-time payment contract of $6600 USD / 8707 CELO, to cover startup costs (subject to 3-month cliff)
    - $6000 USD - for initial setup of 5 oracles
    - $600 USD - for 2 additional oracles
  - Monthly vesting payment contract of $24000 USD / 31668 CELO (subject to 3-month cliff)
    - $2000 USD / 2639 CELO per month for 12 months, according to Tier 2 pricing in the original payment contract.

The terms of service for the oracles operations, as well as the payments, are defined in [this document](https://forum.celo.org/t/decentralized-oracles/3610/18?u=max_dt).

## Verification

### Confirm proposal steps

Run `celocli governance:show --proposalID <tbd>`

### Confirm Release Gold Parameters:

`celocli releasegold:show --contract RG_ADDRESS`

## Risks

There is a risk for the community that the oracle providers do not provide the service they are paid for. This risk is mitigated by making the payment contracts revocable, which can be done by a Mento Labs multisig in special circumstances. The refund address on all contracts has been set to Governance's address, so that in case of a revocation, any remaining funds in the payment contracts will be returned to the Community Fund.

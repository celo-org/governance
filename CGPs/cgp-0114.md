## Overview

This proposal is to fund the (ReleaseGold contracts)[https://docs.celo.org/holder/manage/release-gold] (RGC) with the Community Fund, in order to reward the oracle providers for their service. 4 RGCs have been deployed for T-systems and Redstone. Two contracts are to cover the month-to-month payments for one year of service for each provider, and the other two to cover one off payments.

T-Systems -
One off payment - 2023 Compensation - Details TBD - cliff
One year of service - no cliff - Terms of service can be found in (this document)[https://forum.celo.org/t/decentralized-oracles/3610/18?u=max_dt].

Redstone -
One off payment - Oracle Startup Cost - Details TBD - Three-month cliff.
One year of service - Details TBD - Three-month cliff
Terms of service found in (CGP 0102)[https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0102.md]

The price of Celo was set at the time of deployment, aprox at $0.77. It may vary slightly from my contract to the other due to volatility.

### Confirm Release Gold Parameters:

`celocli releasegold:show --contract RG_ADDRESS`

## Risks

Celo oracles work by enabling a list of oracles to report and calculating a median of the report. One individual provider can not influence the median on their own, the only way to affect it would be to control half the oracles plus one.
There's still a risk of hack of their infrastructure plus the incentives changing for oracle providers to turn malicious. The community will have to be vigilant that community-run oracles are behaving properly.

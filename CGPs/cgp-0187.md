## Overview
This proposal seeks to optimize the current set of trading pairs within the Mento Protocol by simplifying the asset routing architecture. Specifically, we propose to deprecate several lower-utilization pairs that have become operationally burdensome and instead consolidate liquidity routing through a cUSD-centric model. Additionally, this proposal introduces new core pairs with cUSD and updates several protocol parameters (like spreads, limits, circuit breakers, etc.) following a holistic review of the current system.

As the number of assets and pairs supported by the Mento Protocol has grown, maintaining them individually—especially those with lower usage—has introduced increasing operational and technical complexity. Additionally, many of these pairs require dedicated oracle feeds and liquidity calibration, which do not yield commensurate utility.
We propose a shift toward a more streamlined architecture where all major assets are routed through cUSD, which is already the most liquid and widely used stable asset on Celo. This shift allows us to:

- Improve maintainability and monitoring across the Mento Protocol
- Unify swap paths over cUSD (e.g., cREAL → cUSD → USDC instead of cREAL → USDC directly)
- Minimize redundant oracle dependencies
- Preserve the ability to swap between any two assets via composed two-hop routes

Importantly, these changes will not remove any user-facing functionality; all swaps will remain possible through the updated routing logic.

## Proposed Changes

### Pairs to Remove
The following pairs are proposed for deprecation:
- cEUR / CELO
- cREAL / CELO
- eXOF / CELO
- cREAL / USDC
- cEUR / USDC
- cEUR / axlUSDC
- cREAL / axlUSDC
- eXOF / axlEUROC

These pairs will no longer be directly maintained, but all swaps will remain executable through intermediate routing via cUSD.

### Pairs to Add
To enable complete swap coverage via cUSD, we propose adding the following base pairs:
- cUSD / cEUR
- cUSD / cREAL
- cUSD / eXOF

These additions ensure that all stable assets in the Mento Protocol can route to one another in two hops or fewer.

### Parameter Review
In conjunction with this proposal, Mento Labs has conducted a comprehensive review of all active pair parameters. Based on this analysis, we will propose adjustments to:

- Trading spreads
- Trading limits
- Oracle circuit breakers
- Reference asset volatility thresholds

These parameter changes are intended to enhance market efficiency, reduce slippage, and strengthen Reserve robustness.

## Verification
Please refer to the [forum post](https://forum.celo.org/t/streamlining-mento-reserve-pairs/11415) for a detailed description of verification steps.

## Risks
The primary risk associated with this proposal is ensuring that the new parameters (spreads, limits, circuit breakers, etc.) are correctly set. To mitigate this risk, we will conduct extensive testing on Alfajores and publicly share all proposed parameter values in the forum for community review and verification prior to the execution of the proposal on mainnet.

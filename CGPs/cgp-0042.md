## Overview

This proposal is the first in a series of three proposals to launch cREAL. It should be succeeded by [CGP-46](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0046.md).

In this governance proposal, we propose the initialization and registration of the newly deployed `StableTokenBRL` and `ExchangeBRL` smart contracts as Celo Core Contracts Release 6. The tag containing the code changes deployed is [cREAL-contracts-deploy](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/cREAL-contracts-deploy)

The other proposals needed, in order, are:
- Freeze cREAL, whitelist oracles, and set governance constitution parameters
- Unfreeze cREAL, whitelist cREAL as a stable currency, and enable cREAL as a gas currency

These are necessary as separate proposals because:
1. Contract release tooling is needed to verify this proposal, which is incompatible with proposal contents other than contract release and initialization.
2. Oracles must be whitelisted before they can start reporting.
3. Oracle reports are needed before cREAL can be stabilized.


### Status

Currently, only cUSD and cEUR are deployed on Mainnet.

## Proposed Changes

1. Register StableTokenBRL via Registry.setAddress
2. Initialize StableTokenBRL (see initialization parameters below)
3. Register ExchangeBRL via Registry.setAddress
4. Initialize ExchangeBRL (see initialization parameters below)

## Verification

### Initialization Parameters

1. `StableTokenBRL`:
- `_name`: "Celo Brazilian Real"
- `_symbol`: "cREAL"
- `_decimals`: 18
- `registryAddress`: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ce10
- `inflationRate`: 1000000000000000000000000 (should match what it's deployed for cUSD and cEUR)
- `inflationFactorUpdatePeriod`: 47304000
- `initialBalanceAddresses`: []
- `initialBalanceValues`: []
- `exchangeIdentifier`: "ExchangeBRL"
2. `ExchangeBRL`:
- `registryAddress`: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ce10
- `stableToken`: 0xe8537a3d056DA446677B9E9d6c5dB704EaAb4787
- `_spread`: 5000000000000000000000 (0.5%, same as cUSD and cEUR had at launch)
- `_reserveFraction`: 250000000000000000000 (0.025%, 2.5x what cUSD had at launch in absolute terms)
- `_updateFrequency`: 300 (should match cUSD and cEUR)
- `_minimumReports`: 5 (should match cUSD and cEUR)

Logs of the deployment can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaCtGF0U7xTI4OUhPuKc6Dvm8RzSoZE7tlbsAEVbDTs/edit).

### Verification tooling

This proposal can be verified using Celo's smart contract release tooling as described [using the tooling](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts#verify-proposed-release-candidate).

To do so, first install the latest cli:
`npm -g install @celo/celocli@1.4.1-beta`

Then, run the following commands:
```
celocli governance:show --proposalID 46 --jsonTransactions upgrade_proposal.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/master/packages/protocol/releaseData/initializationData/release6.json -O "initialization_data.json"
```

In order to verify the proposal, the address of `stableToken` in the `ExchangeBRL` must be modified manually in the file `initialization_data.json`. The second argument of `ExchangeBRL` (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` in the file) needs to be modified to `0xe8537a3d056DA446677B9E9d6c5dB704EaAb4787` (the address `StableTokenBRL` got deployed to) . The reason is documented on this [ticket](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/7171) and the prescribed workaround is implemented in this [PR](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/7267) as a post `make-release` and pre `propose` step for the generated release proposals.

After the address has been modified, you can run the following command to verify the proposal (after having run `yarn && yarn build` on the root folder):
```
# In the "protocol" directory of latest celo-monorepo master branch:
yarn verify-release -p "upgrade_proposal.json" -b cREAL-contracts-deploy -n mainnet -f -i initialization_data.json
```

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. This proposal touches contracts which impact Celo's stability protocol. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.

## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to add EUROC (Circle Euro) as collateral to the Mento Reserve. More precisely, we propose a one-to-one backing of Euro-based stablecoins (currently cEUR, in the future also eXOF) in EUROC. This has the advantage of removing `EUR/USD` FX-risk inherent in the current model of a one-to-one backing of these Euro-tracking assets with Dollar-denominated stablecoins like USDC and DAI. 

We also propose to already add `EUROC/EUR`, `XOF/EUR` and `CELO/XOF` oracle rates in preperation of the upcoming launch of `cEUR/axlEUROC` and `eXOF/axlEUROC` and `CELO/eXOF` Mento pairs. We also propose to add the related `eXOF` entry in the Celo registry. For more background on the upcoming `eXOF` launch, please read [Dunia launching eXOF on Celo](https://forum.celo.org/t/dunia-launching-exof-on-celo/6261).

The set of oracle providers proposed for `EUROC/EUR` is the same as the oracle providers for the existing rates. The rates related to `eXOF` would be provided by Mento Labs only in the early test stage with the goal of broadening the set of Oracle providers in a future upgrade.

### Status

Following the Multi-Collateral Mento deployment, [CGP 71](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0071.md) was executed to add oracles for the `USDC/USD` rate, which allowed the creation of the `cUSD/axlUSDC` pool to enable direct issuance and redemption of `cUSD` against `axlUSDC`. This CGP is a continuation of that initial effort to extend that functionality to other Mento stable assets.

Similar to previous proposals CGP 71 and CGP 86, we suggest to associate the `EUROC/EUR` rate identifier with the following address derived from the ticker pair:

```solidity
address(uint160(uint256(keccak256("EUROCEUR"))))
// == 0x26076b9702885d475ac8c3db3bd9f250dc5a318b
```

This CGP proposes to enable the following addresses to report the `EUROC/EUR` rate:

#### Mento Labs

1. `0xa633c79ac2c6881c0898b2b417a3aecda6f9eb10`
2. `0xbc32b5e6682bd7b64e52bdceead83f597ed0fd77`
3. `0x110d08157ed0c525f7fd983a857180583767cbcf`
4. `0xa8c15faf676df18566c4b8c4c653e5f992e687bb`
5. `0x6e7c84f83778569016ea0a7f6f119d6b779eed17`
6. `0xf96bf6c3b9ea73150f0d7f452fba685ff456c322`
7. `0xc5bf0748538f8673691bc9c8e4eae386d5987559`
8. `0xe868cd23a3941dfbab10597b103313706a027191`

#### T-Systems

9. `0xBBf07BD413D65C363099934Ca43394dA92C390dB`

#### Di Wi

10. `TBD`

These addresses were provided by the current set of oracle providers and the oracle client distribution for the the new rates resembles the distribution of clients for the other currently available rates.

```

## Risks

- The addition of EUROC as Mento Reserve collateral means that the Mento Reserve could become undercollateralized in the case of a significant EUROC depeg. However, the Reserve value that would be held in EUROC going forward is currently held in USDC and both of these assets are issued by Circle and share a similar risk profile.
- The proposal adds new oracle rates that are not currently in use. It should be checked, and confirmed however by the proposed oracle providers, that the oracle addresses listed in this proposal are correct to ensure the functioning and safety of the systems that will rely on this oracle rate in the future.

# Abstract
Following a grant from Prezenti that enabled us to launch the Mentors Collective (MC) program, 
we now seek funding from the Celo Community to expand our support for projects within the Celo ecosystem over the first half of 2024.
Our primary goal is to empower Celo founders through 1-on-1 mentorship, with the impact quantified through our Proof-of-Mentorship (POM) metric. 

To ensure transparency and trust, released funds will be tied to achieving quality POM milestones, 
with 90% of the funds securely held by Hex Trust and released based on these achievements and supervised by an Advisory Board. 
Your support will help us nurture a prosperous and thriving Celo ecosystem



# Rationale
The pressing need for structured mentorship programs within the Celo ecosystem
has become evident after conversations with a diverse group representing dozens of ecosystem entities. 
These discussions highlighted the challenges faced by early-stage projects, 
particularly in terms of expansion and securing funding. While informal mentorship is valued, 
it often lacks depth, calling for a systematic approach with measurable metrics.
Leveraging the community for effective mentorship tailored to specific project needs is a valuable opportunity.
In light of this, Mentors Collective emerges as a solution to address these pressing issues. 

By optimizing mentorship quality and establishing a robust community support system, 
MC aims to provide the essential one-on-one guidance needed by Celo founders during critical moments in their journey. 
Whether they are accelerator alumni, hackathon winners, first-time founders, or technically proficient individuals, 
MC is dedicated to ensuring that more founders receive the knowledge and guidance required to thrive within the Celo ecosystem. 
Moreover, MC's commitment to providing decentralized support will enable Celo to extend its assistance to a larger number of founders,
amplifying the impact of the support currently available.

Over the past 2 months, we have been providing support to ten Celo founders who are Prezenti grantees.
Our main objective was to connect these founders with experienced experts 
and help them refine their pitch decks and fundraising strategies.
Our dedicated efforts have resulted in 30 successful mentoring sessions,
with an impressive net promoter score of 80 from founders, and the addition of 17 top-notch mentors.

We propose the implementation of specialized mentorship packages with 1-on-1 comprehensive support and tailored activities, 
fostering a dynamic and inclusive mentorship ecosystem. These initiatives aim to address existing gaps, enhance founder capabilities, 
and strengthen the support framework within the Celo ecosystem, ultimately delivering meaningful and measurable benefits to the community. 



# Proposal Details
### 653,323 CELO (€300,529) for supporting 30-50 projects in the next 6 months. 
*Calculated according to past 90-days CELO price - 0.460
We are proposing the rollout of specialized mentorship packages that include multifaceted support and bespoke activities. 
This will foster a dynamic and encompassing mentorship ecosystem, addressing existing gaps, elevating founder capabilities, 
and enhancing the support structure within the Celo ecosystem. The aim is to provide meaningful and measurable impact to the community.

### Goals
1. Support and amplify the growth of 30-50 projects within the Celo ecosystem over the next 6 months through structured and robust mentorship.
2. Position Celo as a supportive ecosystem for founders and projects.
3. Create a collective of experienced professional mentors that can support founders as they grow their companies, accelerate their projects and expand Celo's ecosystem as a whole. 

### 1-on-1 Mentorship Packages 
To effectively support founders, we are proposing mentorship packages valued at $2,500 each, 
which include 10 hours of one-on-one mentorship. 
Our aim is to create a supportive environment that encourages peer feedback, 
network building, and cross-pollination of ideas and strategies among founders in the Celo ecosystem.
Packages themes include: Fundraising, Public Relations, Early user traction, B2B Sales and  Go-to-market mentoring sessions.

**Why 30-50 projects?**

We aim to provide an average of 1.5 packages per project, recognizing that different ventures may require varying levels of support.
This strategic approach leads us to assume we will ultimately be working with approximately 33 projects,
mirroring the size of each Celo Camp batch, which typically consisted of about 30 projects. 
To minimize our time-to-market, and make sure we will be able to support this scale of operations, 
we are in ongoing discussions with Prezenti, Credit Collective, Climate Collective, and regional DAOs
as distribution channels while extending our mentorship packages to support their founders. 

**Speed Mentorship Events**

Hosting 6 fast-mentorship events, connecting founders with our experienced mentors in a safe and trusted space. The aim is to ignite the cohesiveness of our community and offer fast, and meaningful advice to our founders.

**Take Off Delegations**

[Take Off program](https://takeoff.talentprotocol.com/) is a scholarship program initiated by Talent Protocol, designed to offer high-potential individuals a transformative opportunity for growth, learning, and networking within the Web3 community. This program selects a group of 10-15 talented individuals and provides them with access to prominent blockchain conferences, fostering deeper connections within the Web3 space and enabling them to contribute to the growth of their respective projects.
Together with the Take Off program, we aim to create two delegations in the next 6 months aiming to boost the progress of a select group of 10-15 founders in each by providing them with opportunities to attend major tech conferences, organize meetings, and accelerate the growth of their projects.

**Online Demo Day / Roadshows**

Dedicating 8 hours per week over the next 6 months to facilitate demo days and fundraising roadshows for selected startups to support their fundraising goals.
We aim to provide founders with the environment to pitch their projects and strategies in front of investors. 

**Founders Circle Events**

6 Founder's Circle events (10-20 founders per event) to foster meaningful connections between Celo founders while providing/getting feedback from fellow founders.

**Why Multifaceted Approach Is Crucial**

Simultaneously implementing all of our proposed initiatives and activities is essential to enhance and strengthen the main 1-on-1 mentorship package.

**While 1-on-1 mentorship sessions** form the core of our support, these complementary initiatives play a crucial role in augmenting and enriching the overall mentorship experience for Celo founders.
Speed Mentorship events provide rapid, targeted guidance and a unique opportunity for founders to interact with a diverse group of mentors. 
This fosters a collaborative atmosphere where founders can not only receive advice from their primary mentor but also compare it with insights from other experienced mentors, enabling them to make well-informed decisions.

**Founders Circle** operates on a similar principle, encouraging community collaboration within a structured environment.
It functions akin to an accelerator batch, where founders actively network and support one another. This collaborative approach enhances the learning experience and empowers founders to navigate the complex challenges they face more effectively.

**Demo Days and Roadshows**, on the other hand, are instrumental in providing ongoing fundraising opportunities, enabling founders to showcase their projects and strategies in front of potential investors. Simultaneously, Take Off Delegations accelerate the growth of select individuals within the ecosystem by providing them with valuable networking and learning opportunities.

By running these activities concurrently, we ensure that the 1-on-1 mentorship package is fortified with timely advice, 
peer collaboration, fundraising avenues, and growth acceleration opportunities. 
This comprehensive approach creates a holistic and robust support system for our founders, increasing their chances of success in the Celo ecosystem.

### Milestones-pending Funds Stream
Given the ongoing restructuring of Celo governance and our experience in DAO governance, 
we propose a way to increase trust in our initiative and reduce the risk for the community.
Approximately 90% of the funds we receive will be held in a trust account with Hex Trust. 
These funds will be released to us in two installments, contingent on the approval of our advisory board once we reach specific milestones.

### Milestones:
- Initial Funding: €38,529
  - Purpose: To kickstart our operations.
- Milestone #1: Starting from Feb 1st
  - Objective: Prove POM (Proof-of-Mentorship) >70% from 10 projects.
  - Funds Released: €131,000
- Milestone #2: Starting from Apr 1st
  - Objective: Prove POM >70% from 25 projects, representing more than 100 1-on-1 mentorship sessions.
  - Funds Released: €131,000

###  Advisory Board
Our Advisory Board will consist of 5/7 members, with a majority needed to release the funds.
We are honored to have the following confirmed advisory board members:
Marek Olszewski (Celo), Aaron Boyd (Prezenti), Pedro Oliveira (Talent Protocol), and Reuven Palatnik (Credit Collective).
We will provide updates on the final list in the coming days.

### Hex Trust
[Hex Trust](https://hextrust.com/) is a fully-licensed digital asset custodian with a track record of managing $5 billion in assets.
They have [a strong partnership with Celo](https://hextrust.com/resources-collection/hex-trust-partners-with-celo-bringing-institutional-access-to-the-mission-driven-ecosystem) and currently support Mento and the Celo Foundation. 
This partnership provides us with a secure and transparent means of managing funds, 
ensuring that neither Mentors Collective’s Stewards nor Advisory Board members can control the funds freely.
The service will cost us €8k per year and we believe it is worth the cost in order to provide a funding structure. 

# Focus Areas & Evaluation Criteria
With a wide spectrum of potential projects, our evaluation criteria will encompass:
- Comprehensive understanding of the problem space by the team.
- Team’s capability to deliver and implement the project.
- Alignment of the project with Celo’s values.
- Clarity and feasibility of the overall project proposal. Specificity, measurability, achievability, relevance, and time-bound milestones.

# Proof-of-mentorship: How we measure success
At Mentors Collective, we are committed to ensuring the effectiveness and value of our mentorship program. To measure the success of our mentorship sessions, we employ a systematic approach known as Proof-of-Mentorship (POM). This quantitative metric is designed to assess the impact of mentorship on Celo founders (mentees), providing valuable insights into the growth and development achieved through our program.

POM evaluates four key components:
- **Actionable Insights (AI):** This component reflects the actionable advice or insights provided by the mentor that the mentee can directly apply to their project. It is measured on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest level of actionable insights.
- **Confidence Level (CL):** This component gauges the change in the mentee's confidence level in tackling their specific challenges after the mentorship session. It is also measured on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing a significant boost in confidence.
- **Mentor Match (MM):** This component assesses the relevance and effectiveness of the mentor for the mentee's specific needs. It measures how well-matched the mentor's expertise and experience were to the mentee's project stage and challenges. It is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating an excellent mentor-mentee match.
- **Mentor Feedback (MF):** This component gathers feedback from mentors, which contributes to the overall assessment of mentorship impact. It is also measured on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating positive mentor feedback.

Each of these components is given a weight of 25% in the calculation of the POM score:
POM = (0.25∗AI)+(0.25∗CL)+(0.25∗MM)+(0.25∗MF)

We recognize that the importance of these components may evolve over time as we learn and grow, 
and we remain open to adjusting the weights to continuously improve the accuracy of our mentorship impact measurement. 
We are dedicated to transparency and pledge to openly share these numbers and their evolution over time with the entire Celo community, 
fostering trust and accountability in our mentorship initiatives.

# Ensuring Long-Term Sustainability for Mentors Collective
As we embark on this journey to provide valuable mentorship and support to Celo founders,
we are committed to building a self-sustaining collective that can continue to empower the Celo ecosystem beyond the initial six months.

While we deeply appreciate the support from the Celo community, we recognize the importance of diversifying our funding sources.
In the future, we plan to explore various avenues for sustainability. 
These include exploring membership fees, equity or revenue-sharing models with startups, establishing corporate partnerships, 
offering premium consulting services, and participating in delegation activities like the "Take Off" program. 

Our goal is to create a robust and self-sustaining Mentors Collective that can thrive independently while continuing to provide exceptional value to the Celo community.
We are excited about the possibilities ahead and remain committed to the long-term success of both our collective and the projects we support.
